00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:06,046
[JAEGERIST 83A]
Oliver! You okay? I got you!

2
00:00:19,106 --> 00:00:23,026
[HANGE] That's it.
The last of our pursuers, Levi.

3
00:00:30,446 --> 00:00:32,576
[HANGE]
Everyone got turned into Titans.

4
00:00:32,656 --> 00:00:35,576
You're the only one
who survived.

5
00:00:35,656 --> 00:00:37,166
Likely for the same
reason you lived

6
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:39,706
through a Thunder Spear blast
at point-blank range.

7
00:00:39,786 --> 00:00:42,706
You Ackermanns aren't
built like the rest of us.

8
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:00,266
[HANGE] We're still here,
but what do we do?

9
00:01:00,356 --> 00:01:03,646
There's no way the two of us
can stop Zeke by ourselves.

10
00:01:03,726 --> 00:01:06,606
It's up to Armin and
Commander Pyxis now.

11
00:01:08,066 --> 00:01:11,986
Eren might be planning to turn
on Zeke and hijack the Founder.

12
00:01:12,076 --> 00:01:14,196
But thanks to
Zeke's tainted wine,

13
00:01:14,286 --> 00:01:16,036
the Jaegerists would
retain control of the island,

14
00:01:16,116 --> 00:01:17,366
so even if Eren wins,

15
00:01:17,456 --> 00:01:20,416
we'll be on the run
for the rest of our lives.

16
00:01:22,206 --> 00:01:25,126
That's it. Guess it's
really my turn, huh.

17
00:01:25,206 --> 00:01:27,006
Ever since this started,
I've just been trying

18
00:01:27,086 --> 00:01:29,426
to do what I thought was right.

19
00:01:30,506 --> 00:01:32,136
And after everything
that's happened,

20
00:01:32,216 --> 00:01:34,676
it could land me in a cell.

21
00:01:34,766 --> 00:01:36,466
Or maybe you and I
can just camp out here

22
00:01:36,556 --> 00:01:38,226
in the sticks forever.

23
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,346
Right, Levi?

24
00:01:44,356 --> 00:01:46,396
[Gasps] He wouldn't.

25
00:01:46,476 --> 00:01:47,986
The whole world?

26
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:51,026
How can he not see that-- Levi!

27
00:01:52,656 --> 00:01:54,076
[LEVI]
What happened?

28
00:01:54,156 --> 00:01:56,746
Where is that
hairy sack of shit?

29
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:58,536
[HANGE]
No need to get up.

30
00:01:58,616 --> 00:02:00,406
Zeke's long gone,
the Jaegerists found him

31
00:02:00,496 --> 00:02:02,036
after hearing the explosion.

32
00:02:02,126 --> 00:02:04,206
They took off for
Shiganshina half a day ago.

33
00:02:04,286 --> 00:02:07,086
What happened?
How did he break free?

34
00:02:07,166 --> 00:02:10,376
It was my fault.
I screwed up.

35
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:11,426
Had him rigged to blow

36
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,176
if he tried to
break his restraints.

37
00:02:13,256 --> 00:02:15,806
I didn't think he'd do it.

38
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:18,346
I was wrong and he got away.

39
00:02:18,426 --> 00:02:20,516
Worrying about it
won't help us now.

40
00:02:20,596 --> 00:02:21,896
We can't do anything but--

41
00:02:21,976 --> 00:02:26,356
[LEVI] Run and hide?
If we do, what'll that get us?

42
00:02:26,436 --> 00:02:29,816
[Gasp] Fair question.
You must have been lying there

43
00:02:29,896 --> 00:02:32,156
listening to me talk
to myself for a while.

44
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:35,566
What's with your
little project, there?

45
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:37,026
That for me?

46
00:02:37,116 --> 00:02:39,366
Gonna pull me around
with a horse?

47
00:02:39,446 --> 00:02:41,326
Yeah, that sounds like you.

48
00:02:41,406 --> 00:02:42,416
There's no way
in hell you're gonna

49
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:44,376
be staying out of the action.

50
00:02:44,456 --> 00:02:46,706
That's right, you know
me far too well.

51
00:02:46,786 --> 00:02:48,496
Can't help myself.

52
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:54,846
[LEVI] I'm after one thing now.
My goal is to take Zeke's head.

53
00:02:54,926 --> 00:02:57,676
Theo Magath. Pieck Finger.

54
00:02:57,756 --> 00:03:00,136
Looks like our
interests are aligned.

55
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:09,856
[MAGATH] Levi Ackermann,
the man who went

56
00:03:09,936 --> 00:03:13,356
toe-to-toe with one of
the Nine all on his own.

57
00:03:13,446 --> 00:03:15,696
Not sure how you plan on
dodging a bullet,

58
00:03:15,776 --> 00:03:17,736
given the shape you're in.

59
00:03:17,826 --> 00:03:19,996
I couldn't dodge
a punch right now,

60
00:03:20,076 --> 00:03:22,036
and yet, I still
chose to come here

61
00:03:22,116 --> 00:03:24,786
and put myself at your mercy.

62
00:03:24,876 --> 00:03:29,376
Shoot me, or hear me out.
The choice is yours.

63
00:03:34,586 --> 00:03:37,506
Well, hell. I can always
shoot you later.

64
00:03:37,596 --> 00:03:39,676
If you two are
planning to kill Zeke,

65
00:03:39,756 --> 00:03:41,886
does that mean you already
know where to find him?

66
00:03:41,966 --> 00:03:43,306
He'll be with the Founder.

67
00:03:43,386 --> 00:03:44,806
The fact that this is
happening indicates

68
00:03:44,896 --> 00:03:47,146
Zeke's royal blood
is in contact with Eren,

69
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:50,276
or rather, the Founding Titan,
I should say.

70
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:51,726
I never would've guessed
that you would be

71
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:54,316
this knowledgeable
about Titans, Hange.

72
00:03:54,396 --> 00:03:56,566
You know more
than Marley's guys.

73
00:03:56,656 --> 00:03:59,616
I don't suppose you've laid eyes
on the Founding Titan yourself?

74
00:03:59,696 --> 00:04:01,536
I know that the thing
is humongous.

75
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,116
So big that it seems
like nothing would

76
00:04:03,196 --> 00:04:04,826
ever be able to slow it down.

77
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,206
But we've gotta try.

78
00:04:06,286 --> 00:04:08,956
Let's give ourselves
the best possible chance.

79
00:04:09,036 --> 00:04:12,876
Our only option now is to
join forces. So what do you say?

00:06:25,756 --> 00:06:26,756
[CONNY]
I still don't know how I'll

82
00:06:26,846 --> 00:06:29,516
actually get Mom to eat Falco.

83
00:06:29,596 --> 00:06:31,726
Just force him into her mouth?

84
00:06:32,896 --> 00:06:34,306
[CONNY] But if he gets
hurt in the process

85
00:06:34,396 --> 00:06:38,066
and figures out that he can
turn Titan, then that's it.

86

I can't screw it up.

87
00:06:40,186 --> 00:06:43,776

a plan. A real one.

without a single complaint,

91
00:06:51,866 --> 00:06:54,286
and he has every
reason to doubt me.

92
00:06:56,796 --> 00:07:00,376

But he trusts me with his life.

93

what I'm about to do?

[FALCO] Sir? I thought you were
taking me to a hospital,

96
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:21,106
but this is an
abandoned village.

97
00:07:21,186 --> 00:07:24,316
[CONNY] Right. There's just
something interesting here.

98
00:07:24,406 --> 00:07:26,446
Thought you might
like to see it.

99

Is this Ragako Village?

101
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:36,626
You've heard of it before?
How'd you know?

102
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,376
'Cause you mentioned it.

103
00:07:38,456 --> 00:07:42,506
I accidentally heard you
talking to yourself last night.

104
00:07:42,586 --> 00:07:44,296
And that name, "Sasha."

105
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:46,676
You were talking about
one of the other soldiers.

106
00:07:46,756 --> 00:07:49,006
She was the one
Gabi shot, right?

107
00:07:49,096 --> 00:07:52,556
The whole time,
you've known exactly who I was,

108
00:07:52,636 --> 00:07:56,146
yet you acted like you didn't
'til you'd gotten me out here.

109
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,146
Why do all this?

110
00:07:58,226 --> 00:08:00,266
Why would you go to
that much effort?

111
00:08:00,356 --> 00:08:01,276
For revenge?

112
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:02,526
Hardly.

113
00:08:02,606 --> 00:08:05,026
Soldiers get killed
in the heat of battle.

114
00:08:05,106 --> 00:08:06,566

116
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:22,376

It's been lying here for years.

00:08:22,456 --> 00:08:24,006
Never even budged.

00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,046
It's not a threat to us.

119
00:08:28,136 --> 00:08:31,466
Why is it here?
And why show me?

120
00:08:31,556 --> 00:08:32,806
What are you gonna
do with me now?

121

[CONNY gasps]

122
00:08:47,356 --> 00:08:49,066
Yeah, guess I never
mentioned that.

123
00:08:49,156 --> 00:08:50,866
Think you could help me
brush its teeth?

124
00:08:50,946 --> 00:08:54,406
It's a pretty rare opportunity.
Wouldn't wanna pass it up.

125
00:08:58,286 --> 00:08:59,456
Huh?

126
00:08:59,536 --> 00:09:01,456
But first, we're gonna
have to climb up onto

127
00:09:01,546 --> 00:09:03,206
that rafter for a better angle.

128
00:09:03,296 --> 00:09:04,456
The ladder is solid
and I'm not gonna

129
00:09:04,546 --> 00:09:06,006
let you fall or anything.

00:09:06,086 --> 00:09:08,756
So. Let's get to it!

131
00:09:09,676 --> 00:09:11,046
Sounds good.

he wants to feed you
to that Titan!

Please stop.
Don't do it, Conny!

'cause there's no way
I'm gonna listen!

But I'm way too much
of an idiot to care!

[GABI] Falco, you have to use
the power of the Jaw Titan!

Use the power of the Jaw? What?

149
00:09:47,206 --> 00:09:49,426
But what about Mr. Galliard?

150
00:09:51,386 --> 00:09:55,056
Not Falco. He's innocent!
Let him go!

Conny for this, okay?

say to stay back?

[Gasps]

155
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,336
[CONNY] Wait. What are you
doing up there?

00:10:28,626 --> 00:10:30,756
Hey! Answer the
damn question, Armin!

157
00:10:30,836 --> 00:10:34,346
Why? You just told me that
you weren't gonna listen!

158
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:35,926
So I won't answer.

159
00:10:36,006 --> 00:10:38,516

speak instead.

Oh, Colt.

[ARMIN] The same thing
you were gonna do.

Make your mom human again.

164
00:11:14,136 --> 00:11:18,096
You also would've made her into
the inheritor of the Colossal.

165
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:20,926
There would've been nothing
ahead of her but more pain.

It shouldn't take a genius
to figure that much out.

[CONNY]
When she saw me off,

168
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:31,236
she told me to become a great
soldier--everyone's protector.

169
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:33,446
But right in front of her eyes,

170
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:37,696
my friend almost died trying to
stop me from murdering a kid.

171
00:11:37,776 --> 00:11:41,946
Guess that's the kind of soldier
I turned out to be. Pathetic.

00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:48,666
I'll never come close to
filling the Commander's shoes.

174
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:56,586
Look, Armin.
I wanna try and become

175
00:11:56,676 --> 00:11:59,506
the kind of soldier
my mom would be proud of.

176
00:12:03,186 --> 00:12:04,646
So let's do it.

177
00:12:04,726 --> 00:12:07,806
There's a whole world of people
that need saving right now.

178
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,156
[MIKASA]
There you are.

179
00:12:20,236 --> 00:12:22,326
[LOUISE]
I'm glad to see you.

180
00:12:23,656 --> 00:12:24,666
Have you been looking because

181
00:12:24,746 --> 00:12:26,956
you were worried
I didn't make it?

182
00:12:27,036 --> 00:12:30,546
Or is it because you
wanted your scarf back?

183
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:32,666
[MIKASA]
I was pretty sure you'd have it.

184
00:12:32,756 --> 00:12:34,336
I'm sorry for taking it.

185
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,546
I just... I felt like
maybe it could

186
00:12:36,636 --> 00:12:38,886
bring me a bit closer to you.

187
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:44,346
There's shrapnel from a Thunder
Spear deep in my stomach.

188
00:12:44,426 --> 00:12:46,556
The doctors can't get it out.

189
00:12:46,646 --> 00:12:47,646
For one hundred years,

190
00:12:47,726 --> 00:12:49,646
we've been imprisoned
on this island,

191
00:12:49,726 --> 00:12:52,726
but Eren's giving our people
a world where we can be free.

192
00:12:52,816 --> 00:12:54,566
I wish I could see it.

193
00:12:56,906 --> 00:12:58,446
We spoke before,

194
00:12:58,526 --> 00:13:01,536
just a short conversation
when I was bringing his food.

195
00:13:01,616 --> 00:13:03,866
We were talking about you.

196
00:13:05,286 --> 00:13:06,866
[LOUISE]
When the scarf came up,

197
00:13:06,956 --> 00:13:09,626
he said he wanted
to throw it out.

198
00:13:11,996 --> 00:13:14,586
And so, if it was just
gonna get tossed,

199
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:16,376
I figured it wouldn't
hurt anything if I--

200
00:13:16,466 --> 00:13:17,926
[MIKASA]
Give it back.

201
00:13:23,596 --> 00:13:27,346
[LOUISE] I became a soldier
because I admired you.

202
00:13:30,396 --> 00:13:33,606
And I'll die with no regrets.

203
00:13:35,276 --> 00:13:37,356
I pledged my heart and soul,
just like you.

204
00:13:37,446 --> 00:13:39,736
I followed in your footsteps
as best I could

205
00:13:39,816 --> 00:13:42,116
and gave my life to the cause.

206
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:51,626
[PARADIS MAN 83A] The last Wall
Titans are finally marching off.

207
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,296
[PARADIS MAN 83B]
Yeah. It'll be nice to have

208
00:13:53,376 --> 00:13:55,376
a little bit of quiet again.

209
00:13:55,456 --> 00:13:57,256
[PARADIS MAN 83A]
I don't mind the rumbling.

210
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,506
To me, it sounds like
the bells of freedom.

211
00:14:03,256 --> 00:14:06,216
[FLOCH] For the past century,
our Eldian Empire has

212
00:14:06,306 --> 00:14:09,766
suffered persecution at the
hands of the outside world.

213
00:14:09,846 --> 00:14:12,096
That ends now!

214
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:14,686
At this moment,
we're finally free!

215
00:14:14,776 --> 00:14:16,106
Thanks to our liberator, Eren,

216
00:14:16,186 --> 00:14:18,486
and all the efforts of
my fellow Jaegerists,

217
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:20,236
our people have
achieved victory!

218
00:14:20,316 --> 00:14:23,366
[JAEGERISTS cheer]

219
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,156
So. What are you thinking?

220
00:14:25,236 --> 00:14:27,406
You know the Jaegerists have
a place for you at the top.

221
00:14:27,496 --> 00:14:29,746
Are you gonna join them
and start calling the shots?

222
00:14:29,826 --> 00:14:31,246
Think I'll pass on that.

223
00:14:31,326 --> 00:14:32,536
Guess whatever
you're worried about

224
00:14:32,626 --> 00:14:34,376
doesn't really bother Jean.

225
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:35,996
Our hearts and souls,
to the cause!

226
00:14:36,086 --> 00:14:37,756
[JAEGERISTS] Our hearts
and souls, to the cause!

227
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:39,336
[FLOCH] Our hearts and souls,
to the cause!

228
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:41,176
[JAEGERISTS] Our hearts
and souls, to the cause!

229
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:43,136
[FLOCH] Our hearts and souls,
to the cause!

230
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,216
[PARADIS MEN] Our hearts
and souls, to the cause!

231
00:14:45,306 --> 00:14:47,556
[PARADIS MAN 83D]
Glory to the Jaegerists!

232
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:49,556
[PARADIS MAN 83E] Our hearts
and souls, to the cause!

233
00:14:49,636 --> 00:14:52,516
[PARADIS MAN 83F]
To Eren, liberator of Eldia!

234
00:14:52,596 --> 00:14:55,516
I think we should go and
get Reiner as soon as possible.

235
00:14:55,606 --> 00:14:57,686
He shouldn't even be waking up
for a few more days,

236
00:14:57,776 --> 00:14:58,936
so there's no hurry.

237
00:14:59,026 --> 00:15:01,656
Are we sure taking this
detour was a good idea?

238
00:15:01,736 --> 00:15:04,366
We were gonna have to
eat eventually, right?

239
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,656
[CONNY]
So, you think it's true, Armin?

240
00:15:07,736 --> 00:15:10,616
[ARMIN] Mm-hm. If all
Titan hardening came undone

241
00:15:10,706 --> 00:15:12,616
when the walls fell,
then there's no reason to think

242
00:15:12,706 --> 00:15:13,456
that wouldn't include Annie's--

243
00:15:13,536 --> 00:15:15,036
[ANNIE coughs]

244
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,256
[ARMIN]
Wha-- Annie?

245
00:15:18,336 --> 00:15:20,456
[ALL gasp]

246
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:27,756
[CONNY laughs]
Look at that.

247
00:15:27,846 --> 00:15:32,056
Annie was stuffing
her face with pie! [Laughs]

248
00:15:32,136 --> 00:15:33,686
Come on, Conny, that's enough.

249
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,556
She had half that
slice in her mouth!

250
00:15:35,646 --> 00:15:38,526
Yeah, but she hasn't had
a bite in four years!

251
00:15:38,606 --> 00:15:42,276
[HITCH] Sorry! The line
for pie was ridiculous.

252
00:15:42,356 --> 00:15:44,486
Right, never mind, then.

253
00:15:46,156 --> 00:15:47,616
[ANNIE]
Dear Hitch.

254
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:50,196
I happened across
Armin and Conny,

255
00:15:50,286 --> 00:15:53,326
and I decided it was
best if I joined them.

256
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:57,496
So, I'm off.
Sorry for all the trouble.

257
00:15:57,586 --> 00:16:01,206
Thank you for keeping me company
these past four years.

258
00:16:01,296 --> 00:16:05,966
Goodbye. Sincerely,
your gloomy roommate.

259
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,726
Jeez, Annie.

260
00:16:15,806 --> 00:16:19,016
You expect me to eat
this whole pie by myself?

261
00:16:20,816 --> 00:16:24,446
[FLOCH] Comrades of the Empire,
thank you for joining me!

262
00:16:24,526 --> 00:16:26,196
We are gathered here
for the execution

263
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,026
of these two Volunteers.

264
00:16:28,116 --> 00:16:30,866
They've both admitted to
opposing the Eldian Empire!

265
00:16:30,946 --> 00:16:33,496
And in removing these disloyal
elements from our midst,

266
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:34,956
we're taking our
first step towards

267
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:37,746
realizing Eren's dream
of world domination--

268
00:16:37,826 --> 00:16:41,376
by declaring Eldia's
uncontested rule over Paradis!

269
00:16:41,456 --> 00:16:45,376
[JAEGERISTS cheer]

270
00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:47,336
[FLOCH]
This criminal is Yelena.

271
00:16:47,426 --> 00:16:49,806
She took up arms
and opposed Marley.

272
00:16:49,886 --> 00:16:52,516
She lived among us
and fought at our side,

273
00:16:52,596 --> 00:16:54,726
but she did not fight for us!

274
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:58,146
Her loyalty was to Zeke,
and Zeke alone!

275
00:16:58,226 --> 00:17:00,476
She sought to turn the
Founder's power against us

276
00:17:00,566 --> 00:17:02,526
and wipe the Eldian
people from the earth!

277
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:05,486
She was nothing but another
filthy Marleyan from the start!

278
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,906
Thankfully, Eren was
able to defeat Zeke

279
00:17:07,986 --> 00:17:10,736
and put an end to
his traitorous plot.

280
00:17:10,826 --> 00:17:13,246
Nonetheless, this criminal
served as Zeke's puppet

281
00:17:13,326 --> 00:17:14,656
every step of the way!

282
00:17:14,746 --> 00:17:15,706
[JAEGERIST 83D]
Marleyan whore!

283
00:17:15,786 --> 00:17:18,166
[JAEGERIST 83E]
Send her to hell!

284
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:19,496
Well, Yelena?

285
00:17:19,576 --> 00:17:22,206
Any last words
you'd like to share?

286
00:17:22,296 --> 00:17:24,046
[YELENA]
Would you get it over with?

287
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:28,756
[JAEGERISTS yelling]

288
00:17:28,836 --> 00:17:31,466
Kill her now! Do it!
Put her down!

289
00:17:31,556 --> 00:17:36,926
[JAEGERISTS] Shoot her!
Shoot her! Shoot her! Shoot her!

290
00:17:37,016 --> 00:17:38,306
It isn't time yet!

291
00:17:38,386 --> 00:17:43,606
[JAEGERISTS chattering]

292
00:17:43,686 --> 00:17:45,896
[FLOCH]
This criminal is Onyankopon.

293
00:17:45,986 --> 00:17:48,816
He used to be
a steadfast ally of Eldia.

294
00:17:48,896 --> 00:17:51,526
And he had no knowledge of
Zeke's euthanization plan.

295
00:17:51,616 --> 00:17:54,196
That said, when offered
the privilege of citizenship

296
00:17:54,286 --> 00:17:55,656
in the reborn Eldian Empire,

297
00:17:55,746 --> 00:17:57,616
he claimed he would rather die!

298
00:17:57,706 --> 00:17:59,666
It's still not too late
for you to reconsider.

299
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:02,956
[Laughs]

300
00:18:03,046 --> 00:18:04,496
I joined up with
the Volunteers because

301
00:18:04,586 --> 00:18:07,626
I wanted to liberate my own
homeland from Marleyan rule.

302
00:18:07,716 --> 00:18:10,546
And yes, I wanted to help
your people as well!

303
00:18:10,636 --> 00:18:13,636
But how are you repaying my help
now that you've won?

304
00:18:13,716 --> 00:18:15,966
My whole country's
gonna be destroyed.

305
00:18:16,056 --> 00:18:19,726
Eren's gonna kill
everybody I care for, right?

306
00:18:19,806 --> 00:18:21,686
And I get to live out
my life here with your

307
00:18:21,766 --> 00:18:26,316
sad little gang of
xenophobic shitheads? [Laughs]

308
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:28,196
If living on means
sucking up to you guys,

309
00:18:28,276 --> 00:18:29,986
I'm more than ready to die!

310
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:32,776
Everybody on this island had
their lives turned upside down

311
00:18:32,866 --> 00:18:35,826
by sudden acts of
indiscriminate mass murder!

312
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:39,826
So how is it not a single
one of you understands?

313
00:18:39,906 --> 00:18:42,956
Talk some sense
into 'em, Jean! Please!

Sorry about that.

What do you mean?

321
00:19:06,016 --> 00:19:08,316
Don't screw with me, Jean.

That was the Cart Titan!

They got away!

00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:25,246

[JAEGERIST 83Q]
And Yelena!

00:19:26,746 --> 00:19:31,466
Hey. Someone find Mikasa!
She can take out the Cart.

330
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:34,836
Hold on. Was she even here?

331
00:19:34,926 --> 00:19:37,136
Where's Mikasa?

332
00:19:37,216 --> 00:19:38,676
You heard that, right?

333
00:19:38,766 --> 00:19:41,636
He said he'd signal us
with four gunshots.

334
00:19:41,726 --> 00:19:44,146
Jean must be ready to
kick off the next phase.

335
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:45,646
We grabbed enough
food and munitions

336
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,106
to keep us going for a while.

337
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,026
All eyes should be fixed on
the other side of the fort

338
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:50,486
for at least a few minutes.

339
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:51,946
Let's roll out!

340
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,616
[ANNIE]
Somebody spotted us!

341
00:20:07,126 --> 00:20:08,796
What are we gonna do now, Armin?

342
00:20:08,876 --> 00:20:10,546
No choice but to keep moving.

343
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,416
Faster, Mikasa!

344
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:24,386
[JEAN retching]

345
00:20:24,476 --> 00:20:27,936
That's the last damn time
I get in a Titan's mouth.

346
00:20:28,016 --> 00:20:29,186
[HANGE] The Cart's
supposed to be able to

347
00:20:29,266 --> 00:20:31,856
stay in Titan form for
months at a time, right?

348
00:20:31,936 --> 00:20:33,816
Don't you ever brush your teeth?

349
00:20:33,896 --> 00:20:37,196
You shouldn't ask such things.
I'm a lady, remember?

350
00:20:37,276 --> 00:20:40,576
Now you're on our side?
When'd you join up with Marley?

351
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,076
It was last night.

352
00:20:42,156 --> 00:20:44,496
But why'd you do it?
I don't get it.

353
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:46,286
You could have had
a life of luxury.

354
00:20:46,366 --> 00:20:49,536
The Jaegerists would have given
you anything you asked them for.

355
00:20:51,836 --> 00:20:54,166
You're right. If I had
any sense at all,

356
00:20:54,256 --> 00:20:57,586
I'd be sitting in my room with
my ears plugged right now.

357
00:20:57,676 --> 00:21:01,306
But no. Then that
burning pile of bones

358
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:04,426
would've haunted me
for the rest of my life.

359
00:21:04,516 --> 00:21:08,846
Jean. I have no idea
what you're talking about,

360
00:21:08,936 --> 00:21:10,856
but you have my thanks.

361
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,356
Wash up, you smell
like Titan breath.

362
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:17,816
Why me? After everything.

363
00:21:17,906 --> 00:21:19,486
[HANGE] We needed to
borrow the Cart's power

364
00:21:19,566 --> 00:21:20,986
to make this plan work.

365
00:21:21,076 --> 00:21:22,826
You were just part of the deal.

366
00:21:23,696 --> 00:21:26,746
For some reason, they insisted
that we take you alive.

367
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:34,626
[Groans]

368
00:21:34,716 --> 00:21:36,216
[ANNIE]
Wake up.

369
00:21:42,256 --> 00:21:43,636
Annie?

370
00:21:46,476 --> 00:21:48,016
[GABI]
Whoa, take it easy, Reiner!

371
00:21:48,096 --> 00:21:51,686
[FALCO] Don't worry, it's okay.
We're all on the same side now.

372
00:21:52,606 --> 00:21:55,526
[CONNY]
There's not much time. Let's go.

373
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,026
Go where?

374
00:22:02,616 --> 00:22:04,946
To end this and save the world.

375
00:22:09,866 --> 00:22:14,876
♪ Ending Song ♪

376
00:23:40,876 --> 00:23:44,586
[NARRATOR] Strangers become
enemies in the chaos of war.

377
00:23:44,676 --> 00:23:48,766
We learn to hurt, kill,
and despise each other,

378
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:52,016
but what do we see
through the campfire's flame?

379
00:23:52,096 --> 00:23:54,936

"Night of the End."
