1
00:00:09,875 --> 00:00:11,391
Hey!

2
00:00:11,475 --> 00:00:14,191
Sorry, sir. You can
talk to her all day long,

3
00:00:14,275 --> 00:00:15,725
but you're not allowed to touch.

4
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:19,058
Wha...? No! It's not
what you think, Hitch! I just...

5
00:00:19,142 --> 00:00:20,525
I heard that memories
could be transferred

6
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:23,124
between Titans like us
through physical contact.

7
00:00:23,208 --> 00:00:25,258
So I... I wasn't trying to do anything

8
00:00:25,342 --> 00:00:27,659
inappropriate to her just now, I promise.

9
00:00:27,743 --> 00:00:29,124
I just thought I should give it a try

10
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:32,191
to see if I could discover anything.

11
00:00:32,275 --> 00:00:34,191
Well, you are a boy at that age.

12
00:00:34,275 --> 00:00:36,191
I bet you'd like to do
all kinds of 'discovering'

13
00:00:36,275 --> 00:00:38,072
with Annie, if you could.

14
00:00:39,142 --> 00:00:40,791
Okay, I'm really sorry!

15
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,591
Please don't ban me
from coming back, Hitch!

16
00:00:43,675 --> 00:00:45,124
I wasn't planning to.

17
00:00:45,208 --> 00:00:46,525
Annie would get bored out of her mind

18
00:00:46,609 --> 00:00:48,725
if she only had me to talk to her.

19
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:50,725
Huh?

20
00:00:50,809 --> 00:00:53,391
This is kind of annoying though.

21
00:00:53,475 --> 00:00:56,539
How's she this popular
when all she does is sleep?

22
00:02:33,918 --> 00:02:35,434
There isn't that much to talk about

23
00:02:35,518 --> 00:02:36,834
when it comes to your crush,

24
00:02:36,917 --> 00:02:38,434
but have you been
keeping up with the news

25
00:02:38,518 --> 00:02:39,768
these past few days?

26
00:02:39,852 --> 00:02:41,434
No.

27
00:02:41,518 --> 00:02:43,049
Read this.

28
00:02:45,251 --> 00:02:49,368
"The Military Continues to Cling to Power

29
00:02:49,452 --> 00:02:52,115
Through the Wrongful
Detainment of Eren Jaeger."

30
00:02:53,586 --> 00:02:54,634
People are really starting to

31
00:02:54,718 --> 00:02:56,834
distrust the military.

32
00:02:56,917 --> 00:02:58,568
I'm not sure what the brass
thought would happen

33
00:02:58,652 --> 00:03:01,434
when they stopped giving
the public any answers.

34
00:03:01,518 --> 00:03:03,501
In their defense,
it's not like we can go public

35
00:03:03,585 --> 00:03:06,634
about Zeke and the Rumbling right now.

36
00:03:06,718 --> 00:03:09,449
No one can save Eldia except Jaeger!

37
00:03:13,518 --> 00:03:17,234
The new Eldian empire needs Eren Jaeger!

38
00:03:17,318 --> 00:03:18,768
What is this?

39
00:03:18,852 --> 00:03:20,768
Apparently there are protests like this

40
00:03:20,852 --> 00:03:23,482
outside every local military base.

41
00:03:25,185 --> 00:03:28,234
Hey,
Hitch! Lend us a hand, will ya?

42
00:03:28,318 --> 00:03:31,167
Well crap. Guess I've
got work to do.

43
00:03:31,251 --> 00:03:33,167
Armin!

44
00:03:33,251 --> 00:03:35,768
Mikasa! There you are.

45
00:03:35,852 --> 00:03:37,634
I'm glad to see you made it in.

46
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:39,501
Yeah. We need to
make use of this time

47
00:03:39,585 --> 00:03:42,115
while we have it. Let's go.

48
00:03:45,652 --> 00:03:48,234
Those are the new Scout recruits.

49
00:03:48,318 --> 00:03:50,749
What are those kids doing here at HQ?

50
00:03:55,385 --> 00:03:58,501
Okay, yes.
I did meet with Eren that day.

51
00:03:58,585 --> 00:04:00,501
Oh?

52
00:04:00,585 --> 00:04:03,634
I apologize for
hiding that fact until now.

53
00:04:03,718 --> 00:04:05,168
It's proof enough that you were justified

54
00:04:05,252 --> 00:04:08,101
in detaining the volunteers.

55
00:04:08,185 --> 00:04:11,634
How very kind of you to own up to it.

56
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:13,634
This is through no fault of yours,

57
00:04:13,718 --> 00:04:16,234
but you don't know
what the world is like.

58
00:04:16,318 --> 00:04:17,768
It seemed to me that
you would keep waiting

59
00:04:17,851 --> 00:04:21,634
to make a decision until it was too late.

60
00:04:21,718 --> 00:04:26,234
And it was clear that Eren
had similar concerns.

61
00:04:26,318 --> 00:04:27,434
I see.

62
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:30,101
So that's when you told Eren
to attack Marley alone,

63
00:04:30,185 --> 00:04:33,234
so as to coerce the military
into taking action?

64
00:04:33,318 --> 00:04:35,368
I wasn't quite that seditious.

65
00:04:35,452 --> 00:04:38,301
Although, I did tell him that
the Military Government

66
00:04:38,385 --> 00:04:39,834
was due for a wake-up call.

67
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:41,833
That's all you told him?

68
00:04:41,917 --> 00:04:44,368
Why take the risk of
meeting Eren in secret

69
00:04:44,452 --> 00:04:47,634
without attempting to lay out
some kind of concrete plan?

70
00:04:47,718 --> 00:04:51,702
It was in secret, because as
a former soldier of Marley,

71
00:04:51,785 --> 00:04:53,768
I realized that I was in
no position to request

72
00:04:53,851 --> 00:04:55,833
even a public meeting.

73
00:04:55,917 --> 00:04:58,502
So you understood that you were
gambling with our trust,

74
00:04:58,586 --> 00:05:00,768
but the risk turned out
to be well worth it,

75
00:05:00,851 --> 00:05:04,234
because it let you manipulate
Eren into following Zeke's plan.

76
00:05:04,318 --> 00:05:06,502
What would be the point
in manipulating him?

77
00:05:06,586 --> 00:05:08,234
I only wanted one thing!

78
00:05:08,318 --> 00:05:10,749
For Eren Jaeger to know who I was!

79
00:05:21,918 --> 00:05:24,634
No. That's not all.

80
00:05:24,718 --> 00:05:28,634
We wanted Eren's Founding Titan
to crush Marley into dust.

81
00:05:28,718 --> 00:05:30,101
And it worked.

82
00:05:30,185 --> 00:05:31,568
Eren stood up for his principles

83
00:05:31,652 --> 00:05:34,834
and brutalized Marley
just as we had hoped.

84
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:37,748
Actually. He went even further.

85
00:05:38,586 --> 00:05:41,168
Eren answered our prayers for retribution

86
00:05:41,252 --> 00:05:44,702
with a divine fury that we had
never dared to dream of.

87
00:05:44,785 --> 00:05:47,634
And the fact that he was capable
of such an achievement

88
00:05:47,718 --> 00:05:50,702
is proof that he carries
the Founding Titan.

89
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:52,234
Commander Pyxis.

90
00:05:52,318 --> 00:05:54,434
Do you understand what's
unfolding right now,

91
00:05:54,518 --> 00:05:56,168
before our very eyes?

92
00:05:56,252 --> 00:06:00,502
We are witnessing a truly
decisive moment in history.

93
00:06:00,586 --> 00:06:04,168
Very soon, two brothers
will reshape our whole world.

94
00:06:04,252 --> 00:06:05,634
To be honest with you,

95
00:06:05,717 --> 00:06:08,714
I just want to have
a decent view of the action.

96
00:06:09,586 --> 00:06:12,634
It almost sounds like
the main reason you met Eren

97
00:06:12,717 --> 00:06:15,234
was to slake your curiosity.

98
00:06:15,318 --> 00:06:16,834
I suppose that's right.

99
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,034
For what it's worth,

100
00:06:18,118 --> 00:06:21,634
I didn't tell any other
volunteers what I was up to.

101
00:06:21,717 --> 00:06:25,101
I'm sure that you must see
my deception as a betrayal.

102
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:27,502
And it's true that
my actions were reckless.

103
00:06:27,586 --> 00:06:32,434
But it's also true that I was
acting in Eldia's best interest.

104
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:34,701
I'd certainly like to believe you.

105
00:06:34,785 --> 00:06:36,434
Towards that end, you'll need to recount

106
00:06:36,518 --> 00:06:38,701
everything that you
and Eren talked about.

107
00:06:38,785 --> 00:06:42,368
But first, a word of advice
about telling a lie.

108
00:06:42,452 --> 00:06:43,368
To make it good,

109
00:06:43,452 --> 00:06:46,583
you need to mix in at least
a pinch of the truth.

110
00:06:55,252 --> 00:06:57,434
This is somewhere
between absurd and appalling.

111
00:06:57,518 --> 00:07:00,434
How can people still doubt us
after all this time?

112
00:07:00,518 --> 00:07:02,634
I thought we were comrades!

113
00:07:02,717 --> 00:07:04,434
We spent three years sweating beside you

114
00:07:04,518 --> 00:07:07,634
to build the railway and trade
systems that this island needed.

115
00:07:07,717 --> 00:07:10,168
Your people are prospering because of us.

116
00:07:10,252 --> 00:07:14,368
We gave Eldia everything we had, Hange.

117
00:07:14,452 --> 00:07:15,834
I'm so sorry.

118
00:07:15,918 --> 00:07:18,568
When we first opened
our railway ten months ago,

119
00:07:18,651 --> 00:07:21,168
I didn't see this coming.

120
00:07:21,252 --> 00:07:23,434
Yeah, you're telling me.

121
00:07:23,518 --> 00:07:25,234
We swore to help fight for Eldia's future

122
00:07:25,318 --> 00:07:27,568
and we meant every word...

123
00:07:27,651 --> 00:07:29,782
Hange? What's the
matter with you?

124
00:07:31,518 --> 00:07:33,834
Huh? Yelena went
behind the military's back

125
00:07:33,918 --> 00:07:36,834
and met with Eren
in secret? Seriously?

126
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:39,234
Can you give me your word
that she didn't tell you?

127
00:07:39,318 --> 00:07:42,682
She never so much as
dropped a hint. I promise.

128
00:07:44,518 --> 00:07:48,234
Yeah. Your surprise seems
to be completely sincere.

129
00:07:48,318 --> 00:07:49,633
To me, at any rate.

130
00:07:49,717 --> 00:07:51,834
So she went that far.

131
00:07:51,918 --> 00:07:54,168
You aren't saying that you can't believe

132
00:07:54,252 --> 00:07:56,633
she would do it, and based off that,

133
00:07:56,717 --> 00:07:59,568
I think you must know that
it's in character for her.

134
00:07:59,651 --> 00:08:02,434
I don't exactly "know."

135
00:08:02,518 --> 00:08:04,168
We may have approached it backwards,

136
00:08:04,252 --> 00:08:07,633
but Yelena has given us a reason
to detain the volunteers.

137
00:08:07,717 --> 00:08:09,834
Now. I need you to
tell me everything

138
00:08:09,918 --> 00:08:13,615
you do know about her.
For the sake of our future.

139
00:08:15,518 --> 00:08:17,302
My understanding is that it was Yelena

140
00:08:17,386 --> 00:08:19,634
who first recruited the volunteers.

141
00:08:19,718 --> 00:08:21,633
People were doubtful and wary,

142
00:08:21,717 --> 00:08:24,234
so things didn't go so well at first.

143
00:08:24,318 --> 00:08:29,234
More than once, Yelena proved
her loyalty to us and to Zeke

144
00:08:29,318 --> 00:08:31,434
by getting her hands dirty.

145
00:08:31,518 --> 00:08:35,502
Any Marleyan who doubted us
met with an untimely death.

146
00:08:35,585 --> 00:08:39,834
Even when they were friends
who ate and slept beside us.

147
00:08:39,918 --> 00:08:42,234
We overcame those losses
by telling ourselves

148
00:08:42,318 --> 00:08:46,434
it was for the sake of the
homelands Marley stole from us.

149
00:08:46,518 --> 00:08:48,234
That's funny.

150
00:08:48,318 --> 00:08:50,701
Yelena's always argued
for Marleyan rights here.

151
00:08:50,785 --> 00:08:53,634
She convinced us to let
Marleyan prisoners have jobs.

152
00:08:53,718 --> 00:08:55,434
You make it sound like Yelena used to be

153
00:08:55,518 --> 00:08:59,449
merciless to Marleyans.
Why would that change?

154
00:09:01,252 --> 00:09:03,834
Right. Please come
with me, Onyankopon.

155
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,234
I need your help.

156
00:09:05,318 --> 00:09:06,349
Huh?

157
00:09:11,185 --> 00:09:14,434
I hear Hange's been
roaming all over the place.

158
00:09:14,518 --> 00:09:16,234
Yes. The Commander's
been looking into

159
00:09:16,318 --> 00:09:18,168
a few leads we dug up.

160
00:09:18,252 --> 00:09:20,634
I know. I gave the
Commander permission

161
00:09:20,718 --> 00:09:24,116
to take one of the
detained volunteers. But...

162
00:09:25,851 --> 00:09:29,182
I'm afraid that I can't give
you two permission to meet Eren.

163
00:09:30,517 --> 00:09:31,434
Why not, sir?

164
00:09:31,517 --> 00:09:33,434
Because we've just confirmed that Eren

165
00:09:33,517 --> 00:09:36,634
communicated with
the volunteers in secret.

166
00:09:36,718 --> 00:09:39,834
This is likely what
incited him to attack Marley.

167
00:09:39,918 --> 00:09:41,834
It's certainly something
he kept quiet about

168
00:09:41,918 --> 00:09:43,767
leading up to the event.

169
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:45,768
We're currently in the
midst of an investigation

170
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:47,234
to see what all was said,

171
00:09:47,318 --> 00:09:50,234
and who all was involved in this meeting.

172
00:09:50,318 --> 00:09:51,834
Eren has maintained his silence

173
00:09:51,918 --> 00:09:54,634
ever since these facts
were brought to light.

174
00:09:54,718 --> 00:09:57,168
Furthermore, we're still
completely in the dark

175
00:09:57,252 --> 00:10:00,216
about what he did during
his time alone in Marley.

176
00:10:02,452 --> 00:10:04,501
I'm sorry to say that we believe that

177
00:10:04,585 --> 00:10:08,302
Eren is being manipulated by Zeke.

178
00:10:08,386 --> 00:10:10,234
I wouldn't have shared
these secrets with you

179
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:11,567
if you were anyone else,

180
00:10:11,651 --> 00:10:14,316
so I'll ask that you
keep them to yourselves.

181
00:10:16,386 --> 00:10:19,183
You really think that Eren would...

182
00:10:20,386 --> 00:10:23,450
So what now? What will
you do with him?

183
00:10:25,785 --> 00:10:28,302
Is that...?

184
00:10:28,386 --> 00:10:30,368
Hm? Oh, it's nothing.

185
00:10:30,451 --> 00:10:32,234
There was nowhere else to store the thing

186
00:10:32,318 --> 00:10:34,701
so I had some recruits bring it up here.

187
00:10:34,785 --> 00:10:36,234
Please hear me out, sir.

188
00:10:36,318 --> 00:10:38,302
We've known Eren ever since we were kids.

189
00:10:38,386 --> 00:10:39,634
If he refuses to talk to you,

190
00:10:39,718 --> 00:10:42,567
that's all the more reason to send us in.

191
00:10:42,651 --> 00:10:44,234
I know there's no guarantee that we can

192
00:10:44,318 --> 00:10:46,234
get him to tell us the truth, but...

193
00:10:46,318 --> 00:10:48,615
There isn't any harm in trying, right?

194
00:10:49,785 --> 00:10:52,834
The situation is too delicate right now.

195
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:55,316
This conversation's over.

196
00:10:58,785 --> 00:11:01,634
Why? You're right
that there'd be no harm in

197
00:11:01,718 --> 00:11:05,234
letting us talk to him.
So why would he forbid it?

198
00:11:05,318 --> 00:11:09,168
If I had to venture a guess,

199
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:10,834
it would be that the Military

200
00:11:10,918 --> 00:11:13,649
has already decided he's a lost cause.

201
00:11:21,918 --> 00:11:23,501
Excuse us!

202
00:11:23,585 --> 00:11:26,168
If I'm right about that,
then they're probably

203
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:29,433
looking at candidates
to replace him with.

204
00:11:29,517 --> 00:11:31,234
I'll listen through the door.

205
00:11:31,318 --> 00:11:32,634
Hold on, Mikasa! You can't!

206
00:11:32,718 --> 00:11:35,102
It's fine. They're not
gonna catch me.

207
00:11:35,186 --> 00:11:37,634
You don't know that, and we
can't afford to take the risk.

208
00:11:37,718 --> 00:11:39,567
We can't afford not to take that risk.

209
00:11:39,651 --> 00:11:42,302
We need to find out what
the military's planning.

210
00:11:42,385 --> 00:11:45,782
No matter what happens,
I won't let Eren be...

211
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:08,634
Armin! You okay?

212
00:12:08,718 --> 00:12:12,168
I-I'm fine.

213
00:12:12,252 --> 00:12:15,234
Oh, no!
Put out the fire! Quick!

214
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:16,634
Over here! We need a hand!

215
00:12:16,718 --> 00:12:18,234
Hurry up and get over here!

216
00:12:18,318 --> 00:12:20,234
Hey! Are you two all right?

217
00:12:20,318 --> 00:12:22,234
Hitch! What was that?

218
00:12:22,318 --> 00:12:24,234
The premier's office just exploded.

219
00:12:24,318 --> 00:12:26,116
Has anyone seen him?

220
00:12:29,785 --> 00:12:31,249
Give your hearts and souls!

221
00:12:32,186 --> 00:12:34,168
Our anger's finally reached them!

222
00:12:34,252 --> 00:12:35,834
The time has come for us to fight!

223
00:12:35,918 --> 00:12:37,316
I'll fight right beside you!

224
00:12:43,518 --> 00:12:45,834
Our hearts and souls, to the cause!

225
00:12:45,918 --> 00:12:48,302
Our hearts and souls, to the cause!

226
00:12:48,385 --> 00:12:50,567
Our hearts and souls, to the cause!

227
00:12:50,651 --> 00:12:53,234
Our hearts and souls, to the cause!

228
00:12:53,317 --> 00:12:55,434
Our hearts and souls, to the cause!

229
00:12:55,518 --> 00:12:58,415
Our hearts and souls, to the cause!

230
00:12:59,718 --> 00:13:01,834
Premier Zachary had his "custom chair"

231
00:13:01,918 --> 00:13:03,501
brought to his room today.

232
00:13:03,585 --> 00:13:05,168
We believe that whoever
delivered the chair

233
00:13:05,252 --> 00:13:06,834
must've planted a bomb in it.

234
00:13:06,918 --> 00:13:08,301
In addition to the Premier himself,

235
00:13:08,385 --> 00:13:10,434
the explosion killed three soldiers.

236
00:13:10,518 --> 00:13:11,834
We don't know who was behind this

237
00:13:11,918 --> 00:13:13,434
or what their motives were.

238
00:13:13,518 --> 00:13:16,434
All but one of the volunteers
have been on house arrest,

239
00:13:16,518 --> 00:13:18,834
and Onyankopon here was with me all day.

240
00:13:18,918 --> 00:13:20,168
Then can you think of anyone else

241
00:13:20,252 --> 00:13:22,367
who might've been responsible?

242
00:13:22,451 --> 00:13:23,768
Before he died,

243
00:13:23,852 --> 00:13:25,768
Premier Zachary said that
a group of recruits

244
00:13:25,852 --> 00:13:27,434
brought the chair to his office.

245
00:13:27,518 --> 00:13:29,234
Where were these recruits from?

246
00:13:29,317 --> 00:13:31,834
He never told us what
branch they were with.

247
00:13:31,918 --> 00:13:34,768
But as Mikasa and I were heading
to his room for our appointment,

248
00:13:34,852 --> 00:13:38,434
we happened to notice a group of
recruits leaving HQ in a rush.

249
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:40,515
And those recruits were Scouts.

250
00:13:43,918 --> 00:13:45,634
Speaking of your regiment.

251
00:13:45,718 --> 00:13:48,168
I hear that a few of you Scouts
were arrested and charged

252
00:13:48,251 --> 00:13:50,701
with leaking information
about Eren to the public.

253
00:13:50,785 --> 00:13:52,235
Urgent news!

254
00:13:52,318 --> 00:13:53,434
Eren Jaeger escaped!

255
00:13:53,518 --> 00:13:56,367
He broke out of his underground cell!

256
00:13:56,451 --> 00:13:58,501
Mobilize all troops and track him down!

257
00:13:58,585 --> 00:13:59,234
Yes, sir!

258
00:13:59,318 --> 00:14:00,233
Hurry. There's no time...

259
00:14:00,317 --> 00:14:05,083
Armin. The hell is
going on right now?

260
00:14:27,718 --> 00:14:30,834
Quite the crowd. This everyone?

261
00:14:30,918 --> 00:14:32,434
In addition to our comrades here,

262
00:14:32,518 --> 00:14:35,434
we have many who are
still within the military.

263
00:14:35,518 --> 00:14:39,149
Such as the soldiers who killed
Dhalis Zachary with a bomb.

264
00:14:40,518 --> 00:14:42,768
No one can save the Eldian Empire.

265
00:14:42,852 --> 00:14:46,849
No one but you, Eren Jaeger.

266
00:14:47,518 --> 00:14:51,233
It's okay, Mikasa.
Eren will understand.

267
00:14:51,317 --> 00:14:55,682
If we can just talk to him,
then he'll understand.

268
00:15:00,718 --> 00:15:03,282
Go find out where they're keeping Zeke.

269
00:15:09,818 --> 00:15:11,200
His cohorts

270
00:15:11,284 --> 00:15:12,601
have vanished from prison,

271
00:15:12,685 --> 00:15:15,801
along with some one hundred
soldiers and guards.

272
00:15:15,885 --> 00:15:18,268
It's apparent that they
planned for this mass desertion

273
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:20,734
to match the timing of Eren's escape.

274
00:15:20,818 --> 00:15:22,601
And for the record, I have no doubt

275
00:15:22,685 --> 00:15:25,400
that they perpetrated
the Premier's murder.

276
00:15:25,484 --> 00:15:26,801
This group needs a name.

277
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,400
From this point on, let us refer to

278
00:15:28,484 --> 00:15:32,268
these anti-military insurgents
as "the Jaegerists."

279
00:15:32,352 --> 00:15:35,334
I can think of no one better
than Commander Hange

280
00:15:35,418 --> 00:15:37,200
to tell us their goal.

281
00:15:37,284 --> 00:15:39,134
In the short term,
their goal is to ensure that

282
00:15:39,218 --> 00:15:41,601
Eren meets with his brother,
and in the long term,

283
00:15:41,685 --> 00:15:44,868
they intend to reform the
military with Eren at its head.

284
00:15:44,952 --> 00:15:46,400
They demonstrated their resolve

285
00:15:46,484 --> 00:15:49,400
by way of assassinating our Premier.

286
00:15:49,484 --> 00:15:52,134
It's obvious what provoked
them to act as they have.

287
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:53,801
They must've learned
about the Military's plan

288
00:15:53,885 --> 00:15:55,601
to transfer the Founder.

289
00:15:55,685 --> 00:15:58,468
Even though you kept it
secret from us Scouts.

290
00:15:58,552 --> 00:16:00,601
Only because we knew
exactly what would happen

291
00:16:00,685 --> 00:16:02,534
if we did tell you.

292
00:16:02,618 --> 00:16:04,400
In any case.

293
00:16:04,484 --> 00:16:07,334
Many of these Jaegerists
are from the Scouts.

294
00:16:07,418 --> 00:16:10,668
How will you take responsibility
for their actions, Hange?

295
00:16:10,752 --> 00:16:12,868
I'm willing to accept any punishment.

296
00:16:12,952 --> 00:16:14,735
But I won't resign from my post.

297
00:16:14,819 --> 00:16:17,668
That would be the height
of irresponsibility.

298
00:16:17,752 --> 00:16:19,601
And there's a lot we don't know yet.

299
00:16:19,685 --> 00:16:22,334
These Jaegerists could have
members hiding anywhere,

300
00:16:22,418 --> 00:16:23,200
in any branch.

301
00:16:23,284 --> 00:16:24,134
That's quite true.

302
00:16:24,218 --> 00:16:26,601
In fact, I might be looking at some now.

303
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:29,200
Perhaps one of you will turn out
to be a suicide bomber.

304
00:16:29,284 --> 00:16:31,668
Please. Don't be
ridiculous, Roeg.

305
00:16:31,752 --> 00:16:33,401
We've been played for fools once.

306
00:16:33,485 --> 00:16:35,200
So why should we trust you now?

307
00:16:35,284 --> 00:16:36,601
Until the Scouts prove themselves,

308
00:16:36,685 --> 00:16:39,200
they must be contained!

309
00:16:39,284 --> 00:16:40,268
That's enough!

310
00:16:40,352 --> 00:16:42,134
Remember that we have a guest here!

311
00:16:42,218 --> 00:16:43,334
And even if that weren't the case,

312
00:16:43,418 --> 00:16:46,268
this is no time to be
bickering amongst ourselves!

313
00:16:46,352 --> 00:16:49,668
Hange. How many soldiers
know where Zeke is confined?

314
00:16:49,752 --> 00:16:53,334
Captain Levi is guarding him
with an escort of 30 soldiers.

315
00:16:53,418 --> 00:16:56,200
Then there're the three soldiers
who deliver supplies to them,

316
00:16:56,284 --> 00:16:58,400
and aside from myself, that's it.

317
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,334
Please have those three brought here.

318
00:17:00,418 --> 00:17:03,268
Nile. Is the Queen's
residence secure?

319
00:17:03,352 --> 00:17:05,400
Its location is a well-kept secret,

320
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:07,134
but I'll look into it, anyway.

321
00:17:07,218 --> 00:17:08,801
We know what Eren wants.

322
00:17:08,885 --> 00:17:10,601
He'll seek out Zeke first.

323
00:17:10,685 --> 00:17:12,601
And Historia if that fails.

324
00:17:12,685 --> 00:17:15,735
So we must keep both of them
out of his reach at all costs.

325
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:17,134
Yes, sir!

326
00:17:17,218 --> 00:17:18,400
Excuse me, sir.

327
00:17:18,484 --> 00:17:20,200
You're our most senior commander.

328
00:17:20,284 --> 00:17:21,735
So now that the Premier
has been assassinated,

329
00:17:21,819 --> 00:17:24,268
the only person who can lead us is you.

330
00:17:24,352 --> 00:17:27,468
What kind of strategy do you
think we should adopt right now?

331
00:17:27,552 --> 00:17:32,400
Hmm. Well. It seems
to me they've got us beat,

332
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:34,415
so I was thinking we'd surrender.

333
00:17:36,484 --> 00:17:38,334
Against enemies mixed within our ranks,

334
00:17:38,418 --> 00:17:40,134
we have no other recourse.

335
00:17:40,218 --> 00:17:43,401
Even if we did somehow manage
to smoke all of them out,

336
00:17:43,485 --> 00:17:46,400
imagine how much blood
we would have to spill.

337
00:17:46,484 --> 00:17:50,134
We don't have the time or the
numbers to waste on such folly.

338
00:17:50,218 --> 00:17:52,400
It's the decisions we made as leaders

339
00:17:52,484 --> 00:17:54,735
that caused these soldiers to desert us.

340
00:17:54,819 --> 00:17:56,668
That's what brought about our defeat.

341
00:17:56,752 --> 00:17:58,801
But, sir! You can't
actually intend to

342
00:17:58,885 --> 00:18:01,601
bow down to the people who
murdered the Premier!

343
00:18:01,685 --> 00:18:04,200
I knew Zachary for many years.

344
00:18:04,284 --> 00:18:05,801
To live and die by revolution

345
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:09,401
is something that I think
he would've wanted.

346
00:18:09,485 --> 00:18:11,200
And regardless, I don't think that

347
00:18:11,284 --> 00:18:13,401
any of the four soldiers who were killed

348
00:18:13,485 --> 00:18:14,735
would've wanted their deaths to be

349
00:18:14,819 --> 00:18:17,268
the cause of Eldia's downfall.

350
00:18:17,352 --> 00:18:20,668
So instead, you want us to
submit to the Jaeger brothers?

351
00:18:20,752 --> 00:18:22,601
No, not entirely.

352
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:25,134
We'll use Zeke's location
to negotiate with Eren

353
00:18:25,218 --> 00:18:28,401
and trust him to accept
that he has other enemies.

354
00:18:28,485 --> 00:18:30,468
Once we've re-established peace,

355
00:18:30,552 --> 00:18:32,601
we'll once again stake Eldia's survival

356
00:18:32,685 --> 00:18:35,401
on a test-run of the Rumbling.

357
00:18:35,485 --> 00:18:38,401
However, we will not bring up the subject

358
00:18:38,485 --> 00:18:41,735
of how our leader was murdered.
We'll look past it.

359
00:18:41,819 --> 00:18:43,868
If that is the price of saving hundreds,

360
00:18:43,951 --> 00:18:47,282
or even thousands of our comrades...

361
00:18:50,618 --> 00:18:52,549
then we'll pay it.

362
00:18:53,752 --> 00:18:56,200
We've talked quite enough.
Now get to work!

363
00:18:56,284 --> 00:18:57,683
Yes, Commander!

364
00:18:58,752 --> 00:19:01,268
Commander Pyxis.

365
00:19:01,352 --> 00:19:04,468
Please forgive that unseemly
display, Lady Azumabito.

366
00:19:04,552 --> 00:19:07,801
It's fine. Every nation
goes through this.

367
00:19:07,885 --> 00:19:11,268
Still, I'm afraid that I can't
guarantee your safety right now.

368
00:19:11,352 --> 00:19:13,401
Until we're able to settle this matter,

369
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,401
I suggest that you wait at the port.

370
00:19:15,485 --> 00:19:18,801
Right. We sincerely hope for
a swift end to this turmoil,

371
00:19:18,885 --> 00:19:21,801
and for Eldia's victory.

372
00:19:21,885 --> 00:19:24,200
Lady Mikasa. Please.

373
00:19:24,284 --> 00:19:25,601
If things take a turn for the worse,

374
00:19:25,685 --> 00:19:27,601
don't hesitate to make for our ship.

375
00:19:27,685 --> 00:19:29,200
I'm grateful to you for offering,

376
00:19:29,284 --> 00:19:30,801
and I appreciate your concern.

377
00:19:30,885 --> 00:19:34,468
That being said,
I see myself as an Eldian.

378
00:19:34,552 --> 00:19:36,334
I want to fight for
the future of the place

379
00:19:36,418 --> 00:19:38,401
where I was born and raised.

380
00:19:38,485 --> 00:19:40,801
So please don't worry about me.

381
00:19:40,885 --> 00:19:42,601
What are you talking about?

382
00:19:42,685 --> 00:19:44,535
You're the entire reason
we crossed the sea

383
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:46,200
to come to this place!

384
00:19:46,284 --> 00:19:47,882
You came for our resources.

385
00:19:48,884 --> 00:19:51,401
So long as we stay open to trade,

386
00:19:51,485 --> 00:19:53,735
you don't care who leads this nation.

387
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:56,868
You just need the Rumbling
to succeed, right?

388
00:19:56,951 --> 00:19:58,200
That's true.

389
00:19:58,284 --> 00:20:01,201
If the promise of the Rumbling
turns out to be an empty one,

390
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:05,401
Hizuru will say our clan acted
alone and hang us out to dry.

391
00:20:05,485 --> 00:20:07,801
Our investments will amount to nothing,

392
00:20:07,884 --> 00:20:10,401
and the Azumabitos
will succumb to our debts.

393
00:20:10,485 --> 00:20:13,401
Sounds like one more reason
that I shouldn't rely on you.

394
00:20:13,485 --> 00:20:15,401
The Azumabito clan had no choice

395
00:20:15,485 --> 00:20:17,668
but to adapt to these turbulent times.

396
00:20:17,752 --> 00:20:20,334
But as a result, our prestige
has been reduced to the point

397
00:20:20,418 --> 00:20:22,468
where we're now derided
as a pack of wretched,

398
00:20:22,552 --> 00:20:25,134
money-grubbing vixens.

399
00:20:25,218 --> 00:20:27,735
Still. We haven't lost
our pride as a clan,

400
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:29,268
any more than your mother had

401
00:20:29,352 --> 00:20:31,801
when she engraved our
crest into your wrist.

402
00:20:31,884 --> 00:20:34,268
No matter what becomes of this land,

403
00:20:34,352 --> 00:20:36,783
we truly wish to protect you!

404
00:20:38,685 --> 00:20:39,735
We're working with Eren

405
00:20:39,819 --> 00:20:42,134
even though he killed the Premier?

406
00:20:42,218 --> 00:20:44,601
Hey. Nobody knows
if he was behind that or not.

407
00:20:44,685 --> 00:20:46,534
Keep your voice down, Mikasa.

408
00:20:46,618 --> 00:20:49,801
People suspect us of
being Jaegerists as it is.

409
00:20:49,884 --> 00:20:51,801
I'm still not sure whose side you're on.

410
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:52,735
Care to tell us?

411
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:54,601
Armin and I were there
when the bomb went off,

412
00:20:54,685 --> 00:20:57,200
we almost got killed by the blast.

413
00:20:57,284 --> 00:20:58,401
That answer your question?

414
00:20:58,485 --> 00:20:59,268
Huh?

415
00:20:59,352 --> 00:21:02,535
Enough.
Like Commander Pyxis said,

416
00:21:02,619 --> 00:21:05,401
this is no time to
fight amongst ourselves.

417
00:21:05,485 --> 00:21:06,668
What do you think of his plan?

418
00:21:06,752 --> 00:21:07,535
Would you really be comfortable

419
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:10,268
entrusting all our fates
to Eren and Zeke?

420
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,735
No. This doesn't feel right.

421
00:21:12,818 --> 00:21:14,200
Zeke and Yelena knew that they would

422
00:21:14,284 --> 00:21:15,401
never be free of suspicion,

423
00:21:15,485 --> 00:21:17,468
so they came up with an insurance plan.

424
00:21:17,552 --> 00:21:19,601
And now, we're watching it pay out.

425
00:21:19,685 --> 00:21:21,268
Our best bet is to assume that

426
00:21:21,352 --> 00:21:23,601
they have more contingencies in place.

427
00:21:23,685 --> 00:21:26,800
Let's focus on figuring out
what Zeke plans to do next,

428
00:21:26,884 --> 00:21:29,401
before he makes even bigger
fools of us than he has.

429
00:21:29,485 --> 00:21:31,735
If it turns out that I'm
getting worked up over nothing,

430
00:21:31,818 --> 00:21:33,800
that'll be a welcome relief.

431
00:21:33,884 --> 00:21:35,668
Do you have any leads in mind?

432
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:38,601
I noticed that Yelena secured
work for Marleyan prisoners

433
00:21:38,685 --> 00:21:40,535
in a lot of strange places.

434
00:21:40,619 --> 00:21:43,401
One good example would be restaurants.

435
00:21:43,485 --> 00:21:45,201
This building's so big!

436
00:21:45,285 --> 00:21:47,201
I've never seen anything like it!

437
00:21:47,285 --> 00:21:48,401
Neither have I!

438
00:21:48,485 --> 00:21:50,334
It must be your lucky day.

439
00:21:50,418 --> 00:21:52,601
Y'all ready for some fancy dinin'?

440
00:21:52,685 --> 00:21:54,216
Yeah!

441
00:22:02,952 --> 00:22:06,316
Soldiers. Always
rushing off somewhere.

442
00:23:41,507 --> 00:23:43,156
Gabi and Falco seek help

443
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,756
from a Marleyan prisoner of war.

444
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,822
Will the revelation of truth
result in a brightened future

445
00:23:49,906 --> 00:23:52,223
or something else?

446
00:23:52,307 --> 00:23:54,771
Next episode:
"Children of the Forest."
