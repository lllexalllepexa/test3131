set sail for that hangar now

in the ship, then we win.

Let's go. Quick.

189
00:14:57,726 --> 00:14:59,486
Before they have
time to regroup.

00:16:00,756 --> 00:16:01,756
Of course.

No, I need to hold the rear.

the commander got to him.

Yeah.

pretty bleak back there.

Why didn't you take to sea
with the others?

218
00:17:09,736 --> 00:17:13,746
[MAGATH] That floating giant's
a captured Marleyan cruiser.

219
00:17:13,826 --> 00:17:15,616
It's fast enough to
catch up with their ship

220
00:17:15,706 --> 00:17:19,666
and sink them along with
humanity's hopes.

221
00:17:19,746 --> 00:17:21,166
I can't allow that.

222
00:17:21,246 --> 00:17:22,956
Need to put it
underwater somehow.

I'll give you a hand.

They'll be here soon.

Let him come.

This'll be ready to blow
before they can break in.

Last chance for you
to take a swim.

228

No. I'll stay.

229

I've been looking for
a good end to this life.

230
00:17:50,156 --> 00:17:52,656
What made you decide
to help us out?

231
00:17:52,736 --> 00:17:56,116
There's a chance that
you've doomed your island.

232
00:17:58,706 --> 00:18:01,416
Saw some former
students of mine.

out of Shiganshina.

Annie Leonhart was with them.

235
00:18:08,006 --> 00:18:12,006
When I realized what
their plan was, I was moved.

236
00:18:13,136 --> 00:18:16,726
And I was proud to see
how much they'd grown.

237
00:18:16,806 --> 00:18:20,186
[MAGATH] If you hadn't stopped
that train, they'd be dead.

238
00:18:20,266 --> 00:18:23,316
And they're not
the only ones in your debt.

239
00:18:23,396 --> 00:18:25,066
When the dust settles,

240
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:28,316
you'll be known as one of the
heroes who saved the world.

241
00:18:28,396 --> 00:18:32,026
Well, then,
that makes two of us.

242
00:18:34,236 --> 00:18:37,076
[MAGATH] I've done nothing
to be proud of.

243
00:18:38,156 --> 00:18:41,666
I served my country by
ignoring my conscience.

244
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:43,786
They were innocent kids

245
00:18:43,876 --> 00:18:47,206
till I got ahold of them and
turned them into soldiers.

246
00:18:47,296 --> 00:18:49,966
I ordered them to
breach those walls.

247
00:18:51,006 --> 00:18:55,886
[MAGATH] It's far too late,
but I've finally realized

248
00:18:55,966 --> 00:18:58,726
how happy I would've been...

249
00:18:58,806 --> 00:19:02,896
...if those kids could've
lived normal lives.

[KEITH] Well, you might not
think you deserve it, but still,

251
00:19:09,896 --> 00:19:12,446
I've got plenty respect for you.

What are you doing in there?

255
00:19:17,286 --> 00:19:20,036
And those kids would
probably say the same.

256
00:19:20,116 --> 00:19:21,366
So...

257
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,666
Thank you.

258

we didn't have any other option.

going to be trampled flat.

it would help us save

what will you do?
