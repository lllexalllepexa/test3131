1
00:00:02,796 --> 00:00:04,336
[JEAN] I'll have 'em
set me up with some

2
00:00:04,416 --> 00:00:06,886
prime real estate
in the interior.

3
00:00:07,926 --> 00:00:09,636
[JEAN]
All day and night.

4
00:00:09,716 --> 00:00:13,016
I'll sit and sip on the
finest liquor money can buy.

5
00:00:14,846 --> 00:00:17,516
[JEAN] I won't care
what anyone says about it.

6
00:00:19,146 --> 00:00:21,316
[JEAN]
After what I've gone through.

7
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:23,486
My wife and kids,
and their kids

8
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:25,856
deserve to live the good life.

9
00:00:32,406 --> 00:00:34,286
[Knocking]

10
00:00:34,366 --> 00:00:36,326
Jean, it's me.

11
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:40,876
[HANGE]
I'll be waiting outside.

12
00:00:43,496 --> 00:00:45,836
[JEAN] You didn't really
notice anything.

13
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:52,216
There was nobody at the window.
Don't go. Don't think about it.

14
00:00:52,306 --> 00:00:54,136
Just stay put.

15
00:00:54,216 --> 00:00:58,436
Your place in the interior
is waiting. You've earned it.

16
00:00:59,856 --> 00:01:02,106
[JEAN]
Stay right here.

17
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:11,736
[HANGE]
Hey, Jean. Good to see you.

18
00:01:11,826 --> 00:01:14,746
Mikasa filled me in
on the situation.

19
00:01:14,826 --> 00:01:17,036
I'm sorry I wasn't
there to help,

20
00:01:17,116 --> 00:01:18,826
but considering
the circumstances,

21
00:01:18,906 --> 00:01:21,576
you both did well.
Good work.

22
00:01:23,706 --> 00:01:27,126
[HANGE] Levi's alive,
but he's in pretty dire shape.

23
00:01:27,216 --> 00:01:30,376
He won't be fighting
anytime soon.

24
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:34,056
Listen. We made contact
with some Marleyan stragglers

25
00:01:34,136 --> 00:01:37,266
and we've got the Cart Titan
on our side now.

26
00:01:37,346 --> 00:01:39,516
We're going to try to stop Eren.

27
00:01:39,596 --> 00:01:41,976
Killing everyone
isn't the answer.

28
00:01:43,356 --> 00:01:45,816
What do you think
you can do to stop him?

29
00:01:45,896 --> 00:01:48,816
[HANGE] First off,
we have to find more allies.

30
00:01:48,896 --> 00:01:50,486
Our ultimate strategy
will depend on

31
00:01:50,566 --> 00:01:52,406
who we have to work with,

32
00:01:52,486 --> 00:01:53,906
but I doubt we'll be
able to accomplish

33
00:01:53,986 --> 00:01:55,486
anything without
at least you guys,

34
00:01:55,576 --> 00:01:57,286
plus a few more of the Nine.

35
00:01:57,366 --> 00:02:00,326
It's safe to say our military
is effectively dissolved.

36
00:02:00,406 --> 00:02:03,336
I'm not anybody's superior,
and I can't give you orders.

37
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:04,706
I can only ask you
for help and--

38
00:02:04,786 --> 00:02:05,836
[MIKASA]
I'll do it.

39
00:02:05,916 --> 00:02:08,126
Eren's killed too many already.

40
00:02:08,216 --> 00:02:11,296
I won't sit back and
watch him steal more lives.

41
00:02:11,376 --> 00:02:13,386
I know he's doing what
he believes he has to do

42
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,136
to protect us and the island,

43
00:02:15,216 --> 00:02:17,516
but I can't let him
go through with it.

44
00:02:18,716 --> 00:02:20,136
[HANGE]
Mikasa.

45
00:02:21,686 --> 00:02:25,726
[JEAN] Think. Let's say we
figure out a way to stop Eren.

46
00:02:25,816 --> 00:02:27,526
What comes after that?

47
00:02:28,936 --> 00:02:31,106
[JEAN] Assuming he lives,
he's got the power

48
00:02:31,196 --> 00:02:33,736
of the Founder
for four more years.

49
00:02:33,816 --> 00:02:36,446
What do we do once he's gone?

50
00:02:36,526 --> 00:02:39,366
We're still monsters
in the eyes of the world,

51
00:02:39,446 --> 00:02:42,616
and after this, they'll only
be more terrified of us.

52
00:02:42,706 --> 00:02:44,166
If we stop Eren now,

53
00:02:44,246 --> 00:02:48,046
we're guaranteeing the
destruction of this island.

54
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,006
[HANGE]
Here's how I see it.

55
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,756
Marley will presume
that even if they

56
00:02:51,836 --> 00:02:53,836
hit us with another
surprise attack,

57
00:02:53,926 --> 00:02:55,756
we can respond
with the rumbling,

58
00:02:55,846 --> 00:02:58,176
and that threat will be enough
to keep them off our backs

59
00:02:58,256 --> 00:03:00,346
for the time being.

60
00:03:00,426 --> 00:03:02,556
"If we don't exterminate
the island devils now,

61
00:03:02,636 --> 00:03:03,976
it's only a matter
of time before

62
00:03:04,056 --> 00:03:06,566
they come here
and destroy us all."

63
00:03:06,646 --> 00:03:08,606
You remember
Willy Tybur's speech.

64
00:03:08,686 --> 00:03:11,316
What's the world gonna do
when we prove him right?

65
00:03:11,396 --> 00:03:13,486
[HANGE]
Nothing good, I know.

66
00:03:13,566 --> 00:03:16,276
But at the very least,
this buys us a bit more time

67
00:03:16,366 --> 00:03:18,116
to try to figure out
a better way.

68
00:03:18,196 --> 00:03:21,406
Better way? We've spent years
looking for a better way

69
00:03:21,496 --> 00:03:23,076
and this is where
it's gotten us!

70
00:03:23,156 --> 00:03:25,536
We did our best and now
we've run out of time!

71
00:03:25,626 --> 00:03:27,876
That's the reason
Eren decided to--

72
00:03:27,956 --> 00:03:30,246
[HANGE]
What he's doing is wrong!

73
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:35,046
It's genocide, and I'll
be damned if I'm gonna

74
00:03:35,126 --> 00:03:38,596
sit here and listen to you
try to justify it!

75
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:43,846
[HANGE]
I'm sorry.

76
00:03:43,936 --> 00:03:46,646
I shouldn't have
raised my voice.

77
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,686
Honestly, I don't think you're
wrong about what you said, Jean.

78
00:03:49,776 --> 00:03:52,646
It was my hollow idealism
that drove Eren to do this.

79
00:03:52,736 --> 00:03:55,816
What's more, before he
brought down the walls,

80
00:03:55,906 --> 00:03:58,406
I wanted nothing more
than to run away.

81
00:03:58,486 --> 00:04:02,496
I was gonna give up the fight
and cling to life at all costs,

82
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,406
but I couldn't,

83
00:04:04,496 --> 00:04:07,536
because I'm still Commander
of the Survey Corps.

84
00:04:07,626 --> 00:04:11,496
I can feel the eyes of our
fallen comrades watching me.

85
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:15,466
Everyone who gave their hearts
and souls to set humanity free.

86
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,506
Most of them died
too soon to learn that

87
00:04:17,586 --> 00:04:21,056
past our walls,
humankind lived on.

88
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:22,676
But if they'd known,
would they want to

89
00:04:22,766 --> 00:04:26,686
set our island free and
let the rest of the world burn?

90
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:29,896
Can you imagine any of them
being that selfish?

91
00:04:31,766 --> 00:04:35,236
We'll only get one chance
to stop the slaughter.

92
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,946
And this is it.

93
00:04:44,156 --> 00:04:45,956
[Gasps]

94
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:57,926
[JEAN] Hange. In the end,
I'll always be a Scout.

95
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,996
So is anybody gonna
help me out with these potatoes?

96
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:27,196
Or we just gonna
glare at each other?

97
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,666
[MAGATH]
We've gone from trading blows

98
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,746
to breaking bread
inside of a day, huh?

99
00:05:32,836 --> 00:05:37,086
Out of curiosity, what made
you change your minds?

100
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,006
If you let Eren Jaeger succeed,

101
00:05:39,086 --> 00:05:42,676
you'll be getting far more than
you ever could have hoped for.

102
00:05:42,756 --> 00:05:46,266
You island devils will have
the world to yourselves.

103
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,556
We were the ones
trying to save it.

104
00:05:48,636 --> 00:05:49,636
We would have been able to keep

105
00:05:49,726 --> 00:05:52,106
Eren and Zeke
from coming into contact

106
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:55,186
if you hadn't stepped in at
the last second and helped them.

107
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:58,606
[HANGE] I'm only repeating what
I already told you, General,

108
00:05:58,686 --> 00:06:01,816
but nobody here wants to be
an accessory to genocide.

109
00:06:01,906 --> 00:06:04,576
That's why we're all hiding out
in the woods eating stew

110
00:06:04,656 --> 00:06:07,286
instead of celebrating in town.

111
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:10,666
[MAGATH] So you finally figured
out who the good guys are, huh?

112
00:06:10,746 --> 00:06:12,626
Are you kidding me?

113
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:16,876
You seriously think you're
in the right? You're crazy.

114
00:06:16,956 --> 00:06:19,046
You people spent years
trying to murder us all,

115
00:06:19,126 --> 00:06:22,046
and we're the bad guys 'cause
we didn't roll over and die?

116
00:06:22,126 --> 00:06:24,386
Screw that! We learned to
fight like hell because

117
00:06:24,466 --> 00:06:25,756
the only other option we had was

118
00:06:25,846 --> 00:06:27,766
to let your Titans
eat us all alive!

119
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:28,976
We found a way to survive,

120
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:31,686
and now you're gonna
call us devils for it?

121
00:06:33,146 --> 00:06:34,306
That's right.

122
00:06:34,396 --> 00:06:37,066
You're exactly what we
always thought you were.

123
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,896
We let you fester
for too long on Paradis.

124
00:06:39,986 --> 00:06:42,066
The world's about to
pay for that mistake.

125
00:06:42,146 --> 00:06:43,486
You finally won your freedom,

126
00:06:43,566 --> 00:06:45,826
and we can all see
what you're doing with it.

127
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,446
What'd I miss?

128
00:06:47,536 --> 00:06:50,036
[JEAN] Plenty. Not a word
about your shock troops

129
00:06:50,116 --> 00:06:51,496
destroying Eren's home
and making him

130
00:06:51,576 --> 00:06:53,496
watch his mother
get eaten alive!

131
00:06:53,576 --> 00:06:56,086
That's what started this!

132
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:57,586
If you wanna know
why this is happening,

133
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,086
go look in a mirror!

134
00:06:59,166 --> 00:07:04,176
Right. Everything was fine
'til your buddy lost his mom.

135
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:06,506
I guess all those centuries
of Marley's people

136
00:07:06,596 --> 00:07:08,506
getting ground under
Eldia's heel don't count

137
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:10,226
for anything in your mind.

138
00:07:10,306 --> 00:07:11,596
[JEAN] Now you're gonna
play the victim over

139
00:07:11,686 --> 00:07:14,346
something that happened
two thousand years ago?

140
00:07:14,436 --> 00:07:16,226
[MAGATH]
It's like talking to a child.

141
00:07:16,316 --> 00:07:18,856
It started two
thousand years ago.

142
00:07:18,936 --> 00:07:20,486
Compared to the sum
of the carnage

143
00:07:20,566 --> 00:07:21,986
and misery wrought by Eldia,

144
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,946
your island's suffering
is a joke.

145
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,326
[JEAN]
Excuse me?

146
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:34,786
[HANGE]
Okay. That's enough.

147
00:07:34,876 --> 00:07:36,416
If we're gonna be
at each other's throats,

148
00:07:36,496 --> 00:07:37,876
let's stick to
arguing about stuff

149
00:07:37,956 --> 00:07:39,876
we lived through ourselves.

150
00:07:39,956 --> 00:07:41,376
Look, Jean.

151
00:07:41,456 --> 00:07:43,336
Our friend the general is
having a hard time understanding

152
00:07:43,426 --> 00:07:46,046
why we're not acting like
the devils we are.

153
00:07:46,136 --> 00:07:47,256
Giving up our paradise

154
00:07:47,346 --> 00:07:49,306
to save a world
that wants us dead?

155
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:50,766
What devil in their right mind

156
00:07:50,846 --> 00:07:52,926
would do a ridiculous
thing like that?

157
00:07:53,016 --> 00:07:55,646
Have we gone mad?

158
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:57,356
What he doesn't know

159
00:07:57,436 --> 00:08:00,516
is we Scouts spent a few months
living in that world,

160
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:01,896
so we can never go back to being

161
00:08:01,986 --> 00:08:04,526
the ignorant island
devils we were.

162
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,986
[ANNIE]
Tell me,

163
00:08:12,076 --> 00:08:14,496
can you honestly
bring yourself to kill him?

164
00:08:19,626 --> 00:08:22,126
Are you truly ready
to kill Eren?

165
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:27,426
I don't think that's
our only option.

166
00:08:27,506 --> 00:08:29,096
We can find another way.

167
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:31,966
[ANNIE] Exactly what
I expected you to say.

168
00:08:32,056 --> 00:08:35,306
So what, you're gonna
try and persuade him?

169
00:08:35,386 --> 00:08:37,306
He made the choice
to slaughter every man,

170
00:08:37,396 --> 00:08:39,226
woman, and child on the planet.

171
00:08:39,306 --> 00:08:41,316
You think you can
talk him back from that?

172
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:43,276
Well, I'm not assuming we can,

173
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,736
but we're never gonna know
for sure unless we try.

174
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,156
[ANNIE]
Sure. And say you fail.

175
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:51,616
You make your case and he still
refuses to stop the rumbling.

176
00:08:51,696 --> 00:08:52,986
What's next?

177
00:08:53,076 --> 00:08:54,656
It's him or the world.

178
00:08:54,746 --> 00:08:57,116
Can you all see him
as your enemy?

179
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:01,916
That's what I thought.

180
00:09:01,996 --> 00:09:04,126
We're the ones fighting to
protect our homeland now,

181
00:09:04,206 --> 00:09:06,376
and we're going to do
what we need to do.

182
00:09:06,466 --> 00:09:08,586
But if we have to
kill Eren to save Marley,

183
00:09:08,676 --> 00:09:09,756
you're going to turn on us

184
00:09:09,836 --> 00:09:12,886
to try to save your friend
and you know it.

185
00:09:13,926 --> 00:09:15,346
[ANNIE]
Don't you, Mikasa?

186
00:09:15,426 --> 00:09:17,596
Tell me I'm wrong.

187
00:09:17,686 --> 00:09:19,096
You can't do it, right?

188
00:09:19,186 --> 00:09:21,356
You care about
nothing more than him.

189
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:23,936
Can you imagine
turning against him?

190
00:09:25,146 --> 00:09:28,156
If you want me out of the way,
then just come out and say it.

191
00:09:29,856 --> 00:09:30,776
[Gasps]

192
00:09:30,866 --> 00:09:32,156
Leonhart!

193
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:50,336
[ANNIE ] I know exactly
how you feel, Mikasa.

194
00:09:50,426 --> 00:09:51,586
I'm not fighting Eren because

195
00:09:51,676 --> 00:09:54,256
I think the world's
worth saving.

196
00:09:54,346 --> 00:09:56,346
I'm doing it because
my dad's in Marley

197
00:09:56,426 --> 00:09:59,016
and I don't want him to die,

198
00:09:59,096 --> 00:10:02,226
but I can't save him
without your help.

199
00:10:02,306 --> 00:10:06,066
If you really can change Eren's
mind, that's fine with me.

200
00:10:06,146 --> 00:10:10,026
But until you get the chance,
we shouldn't be fighting.

201
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,116
[MIKASA]
Okay.

202
00:10:21,036 --> 00:10:22,826
[Clanking]

203
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,246
[HANGE] Glad you worked
that out! And look!

204
00:10:25,336 --> 00:10:28,416
Our stew's good
to go now. Dig in!

205
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:32,926
[HANGE]
Even with the horses rested,

206
00:10:33,006 --> 00:10:35,426
we've got a five-hour
ride to the port.

207
00:10:35,506 --> 00:10:37,596
From what Kiyomi told me,

208
00:10:37,676 --> 00:10:40,266
the Azumabito have
a flying boat in the harbor,

209
00:10:40,346 --> 00:10:41,476
and they'd been
planning to take off

210
00:10:41,556 --> 00:10:43,896
and observe the rumbling
from the air.

211
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:47,146
We can use that to get close
to the Founding Titan.

212
00:10:47,226 --> 00:10:48,476
[MAGATH]
I knew it.

213
00:10:48,566 --> 00:10:51,356
The Azumabito were
helping you behind the scenes.

214
00:10:51,446 --> 00:10:54,616
[HANGE] The problem is, we have
to find the Founder first,

215
00:10:54,696 --> 00:10:57,616
and we won't have enough fuel
to fly around looking for him.

216
00:10:57,696 --> 00:11:00,706
[MAGATH] Right, which is why
we captured this one.

217
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:04,286
Now, where is
Jaeger going first?

218
00:11:04,376 --> 00:11:06,376
[YELENA]
I don't know.

219
00:11:06,456 --> 00:11:10,586
And if I did, what reason
would I have to tell you?

220
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,926
[MAGATH] He learned about
the mainland from you.

221
00:11:13,006 --> 00:11:15,926
You gave him the knowledge
to plan this attack.

222
00:11:16,006 --> 00:11:17,426
He's going to be
picking his targets

223
00:11:17,506 --> 00:11:19,386
based on what you taught him.

224
00:11:19,466 --> 00:11:22,186
You should at least
be able to make a guess.

225
00:11:22,266 --> 00:11:23,556
[YELENA]
Kiss my ass.

226
00:11:23,646 --> 00:11:24,726
[MAGATH]
Hm?

227
00:11:26,476 --> 00:11:28,476
What makes you think
I'll reverse course now

228
00:11:28,566 --> 00:11:30,106
and help you Marleyan swine save

229
00:11:30,186 --> 00:11:32,396
your godforsaken
hellhole of a country?

230
00:11:32,486 --> 00:11:33,606
How about the fact
that it's your

231
00:11:33,696 --> 00:11:35,776
only chance of
seeing another sunrise?

232
00:11:35,866 --> 00:11:38,906
That won't work,
she doesn't wanna live.

233
00:11:38,986 --> 00:11:40,536
But I thought you
started the Volunteers

234
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:43,286
'cause you wanted to liberate
your homeland from Marley.

235
00:11:43,366 --> 00:11:44,866
Are ya gonna let
your country get flattened

236
00:11:44,956 --> 00:11:47,456
just to spite the
"Marleyan Swine"?

237
00:11:48,376 --> 00:11:50,086
It's a fair question.

238
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:54,296
[MAGATH] The answer's "yes."
Wanna know why?

239
00:11:54,376 --> 00:11:58,386
Because she's a purebred
Marleyan pig, herself.

240
00:12:00,966 --> 00:12:02,426
[PIECK TITAN]
You really caught us off guard

241
00:12:02,516 --> 00:12:05,396
with the Liberio raid, Yelena.

242
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:11,646
But we got a bigger surprise
when we looked into your past.

243
00:12:11,726 --> 00:12:14,856
You were born and raised
in a typical Marleyan family,

244
00:12:14,946 --> 00:12:18,486
but you wrote yourself a new
life story when you met Zeke.

245
00:12:18,566 --> 00:12:21,656
One where you were from
an annexed territory.

246
00:12:21,736 --> 00:12:23,696
As you grew disillusioned
with Marley,

247
00:12:23,786 --> 00:12:26,286
the story got more elaborate.

248
00:12:26,366 --> 00:12:28,326
It evolved into
a grand fantasy about

249
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:31,706
saving the world with
your prince, and in time,

250
00:12:31,796 --> 00:12:32,876
you hoped your fairy tale would

251
00:12:32,956 --> 00:12:35,426
find its way into
the history books.

252
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:38,836
Your commitment to the lie
is honestly impressive.

253
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:50,146
[YELENA] "Save the world."
Those might be the sweetest,

254
00:12:50,226 --> 00:12:52,476
most alluring words
a person could hear,

255
00:12:52,566 --> 00:12:54,066
don't you think?

256
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,276
[YELENA] Who wouldn't
want to imagine themselves

257
00:12:57,356 --> 00:13:01,326
as the savior of hundreds of
millions of innocent lives?

258
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:03,866
To wash the bitterness of
hatred out of their mouths

259
00:13:03,946 --> 00:13:06,576
with the honeyed taste
of righteousness?

260
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:09,206
From where I sit,
it looks like that's exactly

261
00:13:09,286 --> 00:13:12,376
what all of you are
doing right now.

262
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:17,716
Seems to me you need to
have your memories jogged.

263
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,346
[YELENA]
Reiner Braun.

264
00:13:27,436 --> 00:13:30,266
You were the one who breached
Shiganshina's inner gate.

265
00:13:30,346 --> 00:13:32,316
Do you know how many
Eldians were devoured

266
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:34,856
by Pure Titans because of that?

267
00:13:36,736 --> 00:13:38,986
[YELENA]
And Annie Leonhart.

268
00:13:39,066 --> 00:13:40,736
I hear you killed
more than a few

269
00:13:40,816 --> 00:13:43,406
Survey Corps members
in your time,

270
00:13:43,486 --> 00:13:45,286
and that's before we
get into all the innocents

271
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:48,576
you trampled trying to fight
your way out of Stohess.

272
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:53,246
[YELENA] But let's not forget
the brave liberators of Paradis.

273
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:56,626
[YELENA] There's Armin,
the levelheaded one,

274
00:13:56,706 --> 00:13:59,426
who seems far too kind to
cause the sort of bloodbath

275
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:01,926
he did at that harbor in Marley.

276
00:14:02,006 --> 00:14:04,886
How high do you think
you could stack those corpses?

277
00:14:04,966 --> 00:14:08,346
Don't forget the civilians.
There were plenty.

278
00:14:09,386 --> 00:14:11,896
[YELENA] Not to sell
the rest of you short.

279
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:15,276
Everyone gave a heroic
performance in Liberio.

280
00:14:15,356 --> 00:14:17,526
Jean, most of all.

281
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,196
Little Falco here threw himself

282
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:21,446
in front of you
to protect the Cart,

283
00:14:21,526 --> 00:14:23,156
but you didn't
let that stop you from

284
00:14:23,236 --> 00:14:25,536
firing your thunder spear,
did you?

285
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:27,236
And of course.

286
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:29,826
You thought you'd all
made it out clean

287
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:32,826
until Gabi gunned down Sasha.

288
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:35,336
What a sweetheart that girl was.

289
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,086
Even I couldn't help
but feel sad for her.

290
00:14:39,256 --> 00:14:41,216
[YELENA]
And to you, she was family!

291
00:14:41,296 --> 00:14:43,176
You went through
training together.

292
00:14:43,256 --> 00:14:45,006
Went through hell together!

293
00:14:45,096 --> 00:14:48,806
Losing her must have been more
painful than I could imagine.

294
00:14:51,436 --> 00:14:54,686
This stew's pretty good, Hange.
Got enough for seconds?

295
00:14:54,766 --> 00:14:57,526
Oh, we've got more than enough,
so don't be shy.

296
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:03,606
I wanna thank you
for this, Yelena.

297
00:15:03,696 --> 00:15:05,526
You're baiting us into
airing out our grudges

298
00:15:05,616 --> 00:15:07,036
so we can get it
out of our systems

299
00:15:07,116 --> 00:15:10,076
and get our heads
on straight, right?

300
00:15:10,156 --> 00:15:11,916
You'd have had someone
to vent to yourself,

301
00:15:11,996 --> 00:15:14,036
if you hadn't blown
all your friends' brains out

302
00:15:14,126 --> 00:15:15,956
to keep your fantasy alive.

303
00:15:16,036 --> 00:15:17,126
Now you've got
nothing but a head

304
00:15:17,206 --> 00:15:19,796
full of cutting remarks
and a death wish.

305
00:15:20,966 --> 00:15:26,046
Ahh. So this is actually
pretty selfless of you.

306
00:15:29,016 --> 00:15:32,186
[YELENA]
Right. Almost forgot.

307
00:15:32,266 --> 00:15:34,516
You had mentioned another name.

308
00:15:34,596 --> 00:15:36,106
He was already dead
by the time we met,

309
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:38,856
but I remember you said
you were good friends.

310
00:15:38,936 --> 00:15:41,736
What was it? Marco.

311
00:15:44,696 --> 00:15:46,486
As I recall.

312
00:15:46,566 --> 00:15:48,036
You told me Annie had something

313
00:15:48,116 --> 00:15:51,156
to do with his death,
didn't you?

314
00:15:51,246 --> 00:15:53,616
Did you ever ask her
for details?

315
00:15:53,706 --> 00:15:55,416
I bet she'll tell you.

316
00:15:59,496 --> 00:16:01,046
I stole his ODM gear

317
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:04,046
and left him where the Titans
could get to him.

318
00:16:04,126 --> 00:16:05,546
Marco got eaten because of me--

319
00:16:05,636 --> 00:16:08,806
Annie was only following
the orders I was giving her.

320
00:16:13,686 --> 00:16:15,646
[REINER]
During the fight in Trost,

321
00:16:15,726 --> 00:16:19,856
Marco overheard me and Bertholdt
discussing something secret.

322
00:16:19,936 --> 00:16:22,776
If we'd let him go,
he could've exposed us,

323
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:25,656
so we decided
we had to silence him.

324
00:16:25,736 --> 00:16:26,946
We figured nobody
would think twice

325
00:16:27,026 --> 00:16:29,946
about a Scout getting
eaten by a Titan.

326
00:16:30,036 --> 00:16:34,246
So I tackled him onto a roof
and I pinned him down,

327
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,456
and I ordered Annie
to strip off his ODM gear.

328
00:16:37,536 --> 00:16:40,126
Then. We just left him there.

329
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,716
Marco was stranded on
that rooftop without a rig,

330
00:16:43,796 --> 00:16:45,586
and a Titan got to him.

331
00:16:53,306 --> 00:16:55,096
So did he--

332
00:16:55,176 --> 00:16:58,096
Did he say anything
before he was killed?

333
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,776
[REINER] He asked why I wasn't
willing to talk to him.

334
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:05,816
[JEAN] I think that
question still applies.

335
00:17:05,896 --> 00:17:07,656
We haven't been willing to talk.

336
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:09,986
We all just started fighting

337
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:12,576
and assumed it had
to be to the death.

338
00:17:13,746 --> 00:17:15,906
[HANGE]
But we can still change that.

339
00:17:15,996 --> 00:17:18,616
A little while ago, we were
all ready to kill each other,

340
00:17:18,706 --> 00:17:21,666
and now, here we are, talking.

341
00:17:21,746 --> 00:17:24,006
It's something, right?

342
00:17:24,086 --> 00:17:26,716
To think we'd all be
sitting around a campfire

343
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:30,256
sharing a meal with people
we once called enemies.

344
00:17:33,846 --> 00:17:37,176
I stood and watched the Titan
as it devoured Marco,

345
00:17:37,266 --> 00:17:38,516
and then a switch flipped,

346
00:17:38,596 --> 00:17:40,596
and I couldn't figure out
why it was happening.

347
00:17:40,686 --> 00:17:41,436
Huh?

348
00:17:41,516 --> 00:17:42,766
[REINER]
I just snapped.

349
00:17:42,856 --> 00:17:46,146
I flew into a rage,
hellbent on avenging Marco.

350
00:17:46,236 --> 00:17:47,896
I cut down the Titan myself.

351
00:17:47,986 --> 00:17:49,276
We get it, Reiner.

352
00:17:49,356 --> 00:17:51,026
You're saying the guilt
of carrying out your mission

353
00:17:51,116 --> 00:17:52,326
screwed with your head.

354
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:56,456
[REINER] Don't forgive me.
I'm truly worthless.

355
00:17:56,536 --> 00:17:58,746
[JEAN]
I said we get it.

356
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:02,536
[REINER]
I'm sorry.

357
00:18:11,046 --> 00:18:17,886
[JEAN grunting]

358
00:18:20,016 --> 00:18:21,186
--[CONNY] Hey! Jean!
--[ARMIN] Get off him!

359
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,646
[JEAN grunting]

360
00:18:23,726 --> 00:18:24,816
[CONNY]
Easy, man!

361
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:25,646
[ARMIN]
Stop!

362
00:18:25,726 --> 00:18:27,736
[Yells]

363
00:18:30,026 --> 00:18:31,406
[ALL gasp]

364
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:32,696
[FALCO]
Gabi!

365
00:18:37,496 --> 00:18:39,036
[GABI]
I'm sorry.

366
00:18:39,116 --> 00:18:43,996
We came here to kill
everyone on Paradis.

367
00:18:44,116 --> 00:18:47,996
We wanted to stage
a massacre. No prisoners.

368
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,546
We thought the world
might forgive us

369
00:18:50,626 --> 00:18:54,346
for the sins of the Eldian
Empire if we wiped you out.

370
00:18:54,426 --> 00:18:56,306
They'd recognize us
as good Eldians

371
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:58,726
who saved them from
the island devils.

372
00:18:58,806 --> 00:19:03,766
And now, my mom and dad,
and everyone back in Liberio.

373
00:19:03,846 --> 00:19:07,356
I'm gonna lose them all
because of what I did.

374
00:19:07,436 --> 00:19:09,316
I'm sorry.

375
00:19:10,196 --> 00:19:11,816
[ALL gasp]

376
00:19:12,946 --> 00:19:14,276
[GABI]
I understand I have no right

377
00:19:14,366 --> 00:19:16,116
to ask anything of any of you,

378
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:19,576
but we can't save our families
without your help.

379
00:19:19,656 --> 00:19:21,076
So please.

380
00:19:21,156 --> 00:19:24,326
Please don't let
our homes get trampled.

381
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:26,456
I'm begging you!

382
00:19:31,506 --> 00:19:33,006
Help us, please.

383
00:19:33,086 --> 00:19:36,256
We have to stop
the rumbling together!

384
00:19:36,346 --> 00:19:37,886
We're begging you!

385
00:19:37,966 --> 00:19:39,216
We're begging you!

386
00:19:39,306 --> 00:19:40,596
[GABI]
We're begging you!

387
00:19:40,676 --> 00:19:41,516
[FALCO]
We're begging you!

388
00:19:41,596 --> 00:19:43,096
[GABI]
We're begging you!

389
00:19:43,186 --> 00:19:44,396
[FALCO]
We're begging you!

390
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:45,726
[JEAN]
Let go.

391
00:19:50,736 --> 00:19:52,146
[CONNY]
Where are you going, Jean?

392
00:19:52,236 --> 00:19:55,486
[HANGE] Hey! Wait, I just
poured you a fresh bowl!

393
00:19:56,946 --> 00:20:00,156
It didn't work.
We couldn't convince him.

394
00:20:06,126 --> 00:20:07,536
Gabi.

395
00:20:13,466 --> 00:20:14,966
[LEVI]
Please shut up.

396
00:20:26,766 --> 00:20:27,976
[JEAN]
Wake up.

397
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,486
[JEAN]
We need to get moving.

398
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,986
Wait, you're really
gonna help us?

399
00:20:37,066 --> 00:20:39,446
Of course. Let's go.

400
00:20:42,076 --> 00:20:44,616
[JEAN] Get your mopey ass
up already, Reiner!

401
00:20:44,706 --> 00:20:47,916
Your stupid face
fixed itself hours ago!

402
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:03,596
[JEAN] Gabi. I'm sorry
about kicking you.

403
00:21:03,676 --> 00:21:04,766
You okay?

404
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:08,266
I'm tougher than I
might look. It's fine.

405
00:21:08,346 --> 00:21:09,896
I'm glad.

406
00:21:11,226 --> 00:21:14,776
[JEAN] Reiner. You're not
getting an apology.

407
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,276
Yeah, well. I'm good with that.

408
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:23,156
How about me?

409
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:31,796
Here comes the Cart.

410
00:21:31,876 --> 00:21:34,546
[MAGATH]
Stop. There's a problem.

411
00:21:38,376 --> 00:21:39,836
It's the harbor.

412
00:21:39,926 --> 00:21:41,556
The Jaegerists beat us there.

413
00:21:41,636 --> 00:21:43,466
They've captured it.

414
00:21:43,556 --> 00:21:45,976
They must have gotten one of
the trains up and running.

415
00:21:46,056 --> 00:21:47,436
There are tons of
soldiers posted

416
00:21:47,516 --> 00:21:50,976
all over the port in
full anti-Titan gear.

417

418

[NARRATOR] To save the world,
they must stop Eren.

419
00:23:45,716 --> 00:23:47,596
With their doubts vanquished,

420
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:51,846
only their former allies
stand in their way.
