1
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:10,472
Hey.

2
00:00:15,575 --> 00:00:17,906
This is no place to be right now.

3
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:22,973
So fly away.

4
00:00:24,908 --> 00:00:28,424
You've got wings. Use them.

5
00:00:28,508 --> 00:00:29,424
Falco!

6
00:00:29,508 --> 00:00:31,624
Brother? Why are you here?

7
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:33,424
Good. I'm glad you're
able to talk at least.

8
00:00:33,508 --> 00:00:34,772
Colt, move!

9
00:00:35,708 --> 00:00:38,372
I'll carry you back.
Try to hold on!

10
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:49,772
Falco!

11
00:00:56,108 --> 00:00:58,505
Report. What happened, Colt?

12
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:03,624
The Eldian advance squad
has been wiped out.

13
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:07,291
They took a direct hit
from an artillery shell

14
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,824
and got blown to bits.

15
00:01:09,908 --> 00:01:11,624
What of the trench?

16
00:01:11,708 --> 00:01:14,624
It's hopeless.
We can't dig any further!

17
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,958
Oh? And who decided that?

18
00:01:17,042 --> 00:01:18,958
Are you trying to give
me orders now, Eldian?

19
00:01:19,042 --> 00:01:20,691
Insubordinate mutt!

20
00:01:20,775 --> 00:01:22,558
You watch your tone
with Commander Magath!

21
00:01:22,642 --> 00:01:26,024
But, sir. If things
keep going like this...

22
00:01:26,108 --> 00:01:28,424
Falco. You look like
you're drunk.

23
00:01:28,508 --> 00:01:30,624
Guess he must've hit
his head pretty good.

24
00:01:30,708 --> 00:01:33,024
How much of the last four years
do you remember, Falco?

25
00:01:33,108 --> 00:01:34,824
You know we're at war, right?

26
00:01:34,908 --> 00:01:36,558
Who are you people?

27
00:01:36,642 --> 00:01:38,024
Where am I?

28
00:01:38,108 --> 00:01:40,357
I don't get it.

29
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:44,624
Wasn't I just flying around with
a couple of swords in my hands?

30
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:49,024
Whoo. Like that.
And there were Titans, too...

31
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:50,958
Okay. It sounds like
we're gonna have to

32
00:01:51,042 --> 00:01:53,424
re-explain the entire operation.

33
00:01:53,508 --> 00:01:55,424
Just do your best to keep up, Falco.

34
00:01:55,508 --> 00:01:56,424
Here goes:

35
00:01:56,508 --> 00:01:59,024
This war's dragged on for four years now,

36
00:01:59,108 --> 00:02:01,639
but with this battle, we can end it.

37
00:02:02,508 --> 00:02:05,424
All we have to do is capture Fort Slava.

38
00:02:05,508 --> 00:02:07,357
Well, to be exact, we have to destroy

39
00:02:07,441 --> 00:02:11,491
the Mid-East Allied Forces'
fleet in the harbor beneath it.

40
00:02:11,575 --> 00:02:13,291
Once those ships are sunk,

41
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,624
we'll have won this war for Marley.

42
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:19,024
But Fort Slava defends the high
ground overlooking the harbor,

43
00:02:19,107 --> 00:02:21,357
which means there's
no attacking that fleet

44
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:24,824
from land without control of the fort.

45
00:02:24,908 --> 00:02:26,824
So why can't the Marleyan fleet just

46
00:02:26,908 --> 00:02:27,824
attack them from the sea?

47
00:02:27,908 --> 00:02:28,958
Come on, Zofia!

48
00:02:29,042 --> 00:02:31,558
Do you really think we can count
on that navy to do a thing?

49
00:02:31,642 --> 00:02:33,357
It took them four
whole years to establish

50
00:02:33,441 --> 00:02:35,624
any vestige of control over the seas!

51
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,424
And this shouldn't really be a surprise,

52
00:02:37,508 --> 00:02:40,291
but they lost half their damn
battleships in the process!

53
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:42,024
So of course they're
too chickenshit to do

54
00:02:42,107 --> 00:02:43,758
a single friggin' thing
until we've taken this

55
00:02:43,842 --> 00:02:46,291
massive death trap of a fort for them!

56
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,424
Screw every single one of those
stupid, incompetent cowards!

57
00:02:48,508 --> 00:02:52,024
Udo. Calm it down before
you squeeze Falco's head off.

58
00:02:52,107 --> 00:02:54,758
Oh, uh. Sorry.

59
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,024
So what gives?

60
00:02:56,107 --> 00:02:57,958
Why did they send us to the front lines?

61
00:02:58,042 --> 00:02:59,491
It's not like four warrior candidates

62
00:02:59,575 --> 00:03:01,024
can make a real difference.

63
00:03:01,107 --> 00:03:03,424
First of all, you can speak for yourself.

64
00:03:03,508 --> 00:03:05,624
Second, they wanna judge us.

65
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:07,939
They're choosing their next warrior.

66
00:03:09,708 --> 00:03:11,558
The time is almost here.

67
00:03:11,642 --> 00:03:13,691
Commander Magath chose the front lines

68
00:03:13,775 --> 00:03:15,958
for the location of our final test.

69
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:18,439
He knows what's on the horizon.

70
00:03:19,175 --> 00:03:21,357
The person he chooses
will be at the center

71
00:03:21,441 --> 00:03:23,758
of the plan to conquer Paradis.

72
00:03:23,842 --> 00:03:26,506
The successor to the Armored Titan.

73
00:05:07,642 --> 00:05:09,572
The Armored Titan.

74
00:05:10,508 --> 00:05:13,639
I wonder which one of us it'll be.

75
00:05:15,842 --> 00:05:17,624
Shut up. No you don't.

76
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,491
You've made it perfectly
clear that you don't think

77
00:05:19,575 --> 00:05:21,558
any of us come close to you, Gabi.

78
00:05:21,642 --> 00:05:24,358
Well yeah, that's because you don't.

79
00:05:24,442 --> 00:05:27,358
True. Gabi has us
three soundly beat.

80
00:05:27,442 --> 00:05:29,624
Tch. Not in terms
of grades, she doesn't.

81
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:32,558
No. They don't care
about our grades, Udo.

82
00:05:32,642 --> 00:05:34,358
It's like I keep telling you.

83
00:05:34,442 --> 00:05:36,358
The difference between
me and the three of you

84
00:05:36,442 --> 00:05:37,957
is that I'm prepared.

85
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,824
To shoulder the fate of us Eldians,

86
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:44,624
and purge that island of devils
who've only made us suffer.

87
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:46,824
I'll slaughter every one of them.

88
00:05:46,907 --> 00:05:48,758
I'll win that war, and prove to the world

89
00:05:48,842 --> 00:05:51,024
they don't have to fear us anymore.

90
00:05:51,108 --> 00:05:53,957
That the only Eldians
left are good Eldians!

91
00:05:54,516 --> 00:05:56,233
I won't be defeated.

92
00:05:56,317 --> 00:05:59,814
Not until everyone in the
internment zone is set free.

93
00:06:02,382 --> 00:06:05,347
Hey. Just what are
you doing with those?

94
00:06:06,516 --> 00:06:08,499
Looks cool. Right?

95
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,432
It won't work, Commander Magath!

96
00:06:10,516 --> 00:06:12,233
If we try to take out the railway tracks

97
00:06:12,317 --> 00:06:14,499
with nothing but infantry,
we'll get mowed down

98
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:17,033
by machine-gun fire
before we can do a thing.

99
00:06:17,117 --> 00:06:20,833
That trench is fully manned.
It's an airtight defense.

100
00:06:20,917 --> 00:06:22,233
On top of that, they have artillery

101
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:24,499
supporting them from inside the fort.

102
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,899
If we stay put,
it's only a matter of time

103
00:06:26,983 --> 00:06:29,833
before shells start
raining down on our heads.

104
00:06:29,917 --> 00:06:33,299
It sounds like you
have an idea. Go on.

105
00:06:33,382 --> 00:06:34,432
Let's use them.

106
00:06:34,516 --> 00:06:37,300
We need to unleash Jaws and Cart now.

107
00:06:37,383 --> 00:06:39,499
Galliard and Pieck
should be able to do it.

108
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:41,299
They can wipe out
the enemies in the trench

109
00:06:41,382 --> 00:06:43,432
and the pillbox in the blink of an eye.

110
00:06:43,516 --> 00:06:44,348
Won't work.

111
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:48,499
They'll beat us if we're playing
our cards the wrong way.

112
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:51,081
Commander Magath.
It's coming through now.

113
00:06:52,117 --> 00:06:53,814
What is, sir?

114
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:58,033
A train. An armored train.

115
00:06:58,117 --> 00:07:00,033
Equipped with two big guns in the front,

116
00:07:00,117 --> 00:07:01,833
and two more in the back.

117
00:07:01,917 --> 00:07:04,099
They're the Allied Forces'
newest weapons:

118
00:07:04,183 --> 00:07:06,033
Anti-Titan cannons.

119
00:07:06,117 --> 00:07:09,499
They fire 150-millimeter
armor piercing shells,

120
00:07:09,583 --> 00:07:13,033
capable of bringing down
a Titan with a single shot.

121
00:07:13,117 --> 00:07:14,233
Even one of the Nine.

122
00:07:14,316 --> 00:07:18,298
Maybe, but both of our Titans
are incredibly fast, sir.

123
00:07:18,382 --> 00:07:19,967
The odds of them getting
hit in the neck are so...

124
00:07:20,051 --> 00:07:22,298
And, what if it happens?

125
00:07:22,382 --> 00:07:26,099
We'd lose a warrior, and the
power of yet another Titan.

126
00:07:26,183 --> 00:07:27,298
Plus there's no guarantee

127
00:07:27,382 --> 00:07:29,499
that we'd be able to reclaim that power.

128
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:32,499
That's right. We'd be
repeating the mistake we made

129
00:07:32,583 --> 00:07:35,499
when we tried to take the
Founding Titan nine years ago.

130
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,099
We're two Titans down.

131
00:07:37,183 --> 00:07:39,833
We need to protect the ones we have left.

132
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:42,033
The loss of the Colossal
and Female Titans

133
00:07:42,117 --> 00:07:44,899
caused a perceived lapse
in Marley's strength.

134
00:07:44,983 --> 00:07:49,298
That sparked this war and
delayed the Paradis Operation.

135
00:07:49,382 --> 00:07:50,899
What is it that makes our motherland

136
00:07:50,983 --> 00:07:53,232
the great empire it is today?

137
00:07:53,316 --> 00:07:55,432
The Nine, sir. Or the seven.

138
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,633
Five now.

139
00:07:56,717 --> 00:08:00,033
And our nation won't last if
we keep throwing them away.

140
00:08:00,117 --> 00:08:02,432
The power of Marley's Titans is absolute,

141
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:05,432
that is a fact which must never change.

142
00:08:05,516 --> 00:08:08,299
Line up the Eldians.
Have them prepare for a charge.

143
00:08:08,383 --> 00:08:09,099
Yes, sir!

144
00:08:09,183 --> 00:08:11,033
Please reconsider!
If they charge...

145
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:12,899
What's the matter, Eldian?

146
00:08:12,983 --> 00:08:15,033
Are you not loyal soldiers who've sworn

147
00:08:15,117 --> 00:08:17,280
to fight and die for Marley?

148
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:23,033
This is a chance for the 800 Eldians here

149
00:08:23,117 --> 00:08:26,948
to atone for the past and serve
our motherland with honor.

150
00:08:32,383 --> 00:08:34,833
Yes. All creatures drink
of joy at nature's breast.

151
00:08:34,917 --> 00:08:36,432
All Right.
Soldiers at the ready!

152
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,681
Up! Prepare to attack!

153
00:08:39,917 --> 00:08:42,232
Come on! Stand up!

154
00:08:42,316 --> 00:08:46,033
Eldians! Your target is
the enemy railway track.

155
00:08:46,117 --> 00:08:49,432
It's well defended, but you
must succeed at any cost.

156
00:08:49,516 --> 00:08:50,699
Guard the suicide squad.

157
00:08:50,783 --> 00:08:54,833
They'll charge the enemy bunker
and disable their machine gun.

158
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:57,766
You may be spawn of the devil,
but through your actions here,

159
00:08:57,850 --> 00:09:00,099
you can cleanse yourselves
of that disgrace!

160
00:09:00,182 --> 00:09:03,099
This is your chance to honor
and be honored in turn

161
00:09:03,182 --> 00:09:05,166
by our motherland!

162
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,899
Prepare to prove your worth.

163
00:09:06,983 --> 00:09:08,499
Yes, sir!

164
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:11,432
You Warrior candidates
will stand by here.

165
00:09:11,516 --> 00:09:13,833
If I have to trade 800 Eldian soldiers

166
00:09:13,917 --> 00:09:15,899
to take out those tracks, then so be it,

167
00:09:15,983 --> 00:09:18,499
but the tracks must be destroyed.

168
00:09:18,583 --> 00:09:22,366
As long as that armored train is
prowling the fort's perimeter,

169
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,033
neither Beast nor Armored
can be called upon

170
00:09:25,117 --> 00:09:26,299
to finish the job.

171
00:09:26,383 --> 00:09:27,948
Yeah. I know, but...

172
00:09:29,182 --> 00:09:30,033
Look, Colt.

173
00:09:30,117 --> 00:09:32,433
You're the chosen successor
of the Beast Titan.

174
00:09:32,517 --> 00:09:34,366
You need to take a page from Zeke's book

175
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:36,380
and learn what it means to lead.

176
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:47,899
Perfect. We can destroy
the tracks and the train.

177
00:09:47,983 --> 00:09:50,299
Why don't'cha let me handle this, sir?

178
00:09:50,383 --> 00:09:51,099
Huh?

179
00:09:51,182 --> 00:09:53,833
Ta-da! If you'll let me.

180
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:57,048
I'm sure that I can take out
that armored train by myself!

181
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,299
Hey. Wait.

182
00:10:00,383 --> 00:10:02,299
You're too valuable an asset.

183
00:10:02,383 --> 00:10:06,033
This country spent a lot of
money to train you. Denied.

184
00:10:06,116 --> 00:10:08,033
It's true. I'm super valuable,

185
00:10:08,116 --> 00:10:10,299
especially compared to these three.

186
00:10:10,383 --> 00:10:13,098
Honestly, you might never
find a warrior candidate

187
00:10:13,182 --> 00:10:15,299
who's as talented as me.

188
00:10:15,383 --> 00:10:18,499
Even then. They won't
be this cute.

189
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,833
But if I pull this off,
you can take out the train

190
00:10:20,917 --> 00:10:24,299
without needing to sacrifice
that 800-man unit!

191
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,899
And if you fail?

192
00:10:25,983 --> 00:10:28,899
Then you'll lose your
most promising candidate,

193
00:10:28,983 --> 00:10:31,681
as well as a bundle of
seven hand grenades.

194
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,899
That said, sir, if you really
think I'm more valuable

195
00:10:37,983 --> 00:10:41,099
than 800 Eldian infantrymen, I get it.

196
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:44,232
To think that you'd sacrifice
that many soldiers just for me.

197
00:10:44,316 --> 00:10:47,098
I knew you loved me deep down,
but I didn't know how deep.

198
00:10:47,182 --> 00:10:50,899
Fine. Go ahead.

199
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:51,899
No. Gabi.

200
00:10:51,983 --> 00:10:53,033
Mark my words.

201
00:10:53,116 --> 00:10:56,098
I'll destroy that train and
prove no warrior candidate

202
00:10:56,182 --> 00:10:58,881
deserves to inherit
the Armor more than me.

203
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,499
What are you doing?

204
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:07,967
My plan won't work
if I'm in uniform, sir.

205
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,098
With your permission, I'd like
to remove my armband as well.

206
00:11:11,182 --> 00:11:12,180
Granted.

207
00:11:19,183 --> 00:11:22,214
Hey. There's someone
coming. Look there.

208
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,299
It's a woman. A girl, really.

209
00:11:27,383 --> 00:11:29,099
Looks like she's trying to surrender.

210
00:11:29,183 --> 00:11:32,099
Yeah, right. Don't trust it,
she could be Eldian.

211
00:11:32,183 --> 00:11:35,366
She's limping, as if she's
wounded or something.

212
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,848
Maybe her foot's been shackled?

213
00:11:38,983 --> 00:11:41,232
Who
cares? She probably is Eldian.

214
00:11:41,316 --> 00:11:43,099
Shoot her before she transforms!

215
00:11:43,183 --> 00:11:44,499
I don't shoot kids.

216
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,899
You've got a gun:
If you wanna shoot her, do it.

217
00:11:46,983 --> 00:11:49,748
Shit.

218
00:11:54,983 --> 00:11:56,180
What the...?

219
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,114
Not yet.

220
00:12:11,851 --> 00:12:13,147
Wait for it.

221
00:12:16,383 --> 00:12:17,499
Not yet.

222
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:18,899
She's just lying there.

223
00:12:18,982 --> 00:12:21,114
Who cares? Shoot her!

224
00:12:24,917 --> 00:12:29,514
Here goes nothing!

225
00:12:38,517 --> 00:12:40,232
She pulled it off.

226
00:12:40,316 --> 00:12:42,047
Galliard! You're up!

227
00:12:46,317 --> 00:12:50,099
Dammit! You cowardly bastards.

228
00:12:50,183 --> 00:12:54,233
This... is exactly why

229
00:12:54,317 --> 00:12:56,947
we should kill every one of you on sight.

230
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,233
Gabi!

231
00:13:00,317 --> 00:13:02,147
Hold on. Falco!

232
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:22,180
Galliard, thank you!

233
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,299
Our forces have disabled
the armored train.

234
00:13:40,383 --> 00:13:43,299
We can now commence the airborne assault.

235
00:13:43,383 --> 00:13:45,966
The plan from this point
is straightforward.

236
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:49,781
Zeke will be our spear,
and Reiner our shield.

237
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,518
That really hurts, damn it.

238
00:14:57,602 --> 00:14:58,585
I'm a Marleyan, so why...

239
00:14:58,669 --> 00:14:59,452
'Kay.

240
00:14:59,536 --> 00:15:01,652
Hey, what are you doing? Falco?

241
00:15:01,736 --> 00:15:03,918
Come on. You know.

242
00:15:04,002 --> 00:15:04,652
This guy's done.

243
00:15:04,736 --> 00:15:06,918
He's in no shape to fight anymore.

244
00:15:07,002 --> 00:15:09,385
Udo. Can you spare a tourniquet?

245
00:15:09,469 --> 00:15:12,986
Dumb brat. You should've
just finished him off.

246
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,452
Is this supposed to be your
big selling point, Falco?

247
00:15:16,536 --> 00:15:19,585
You wanna outshine the girl who
just won this battle for Marley

248
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:22,718
by being a stickler for the laws of war?

249
00:15:22,802 --> 00:15:25,253
This won't help you earn the Armored.

250
00:15:25,336 --> 00:15:26,500
I don't care.

251
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,333
You're such a weirdo.

252
00:15:31,402 --> 00:15:33,399
He's saying something.

253
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,718
Can you interpret?

254
00:15:38,802 --> 00:15:40,252
Tell him that I managed
to stop his bleeding

255
00:15:40,336 --> 00:15:41,385
so he doesn't need to be afra...

256
00:15:41,469 --> 00:15:43,518
"Do not touch me."

257
00:15:43,602 --> 00:15:45,585
"I'll be tainted."

258
00:15:45,669 --> 00:15:48,500
"You filthy devil," he says.

259
00:15:59,003 --> 00:16:00,718
Retreat!

260
00:16:00,802 --> 00:16:02,318
Hurry up!

261
00:16:02,402 --> 00:16:03,518
Get away from the fort!

262
00:16:03,602 --> 00:16:05,667
Don't get caught in it!

263
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,700
It's beginning.

264
00:17:35,602 --> 00:17:37,533
No! Please!

265
00:17:44,736 --> 00:17:48,919
It's true.
You people are devils.

266
00:17:49,003 --> 00:17:51,586
The Marleyans I'm descended from

267
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,252
were preyed upon in the same way.

268
00:17:54,336 --> 00:17:56,852
By Eldians like you.

269
00:17:56,936 --> 00:17:58,400
Fire!

270
00:18:08,402 --> 00:18:10,718
The kinetic bombardment was effective,

271
00:18:10,802 --> 00:18:12,652
but due to the height
they were dropped from,

272
00:18:12,736 --> 00:18:16,919
roughly half the Titans deployed
were killed on impact.

273
00:18:17,003 --> 00:18:20,919
The enemy still has a number
of anti-Titan cannons.

274
00:18:21,003 --> 00:18:23,385
That's 28.29.

275
00:18:23,469 --> 00:18:25,852
I know how many and where they are now.

276
00:18:25,936 --> 00:18:27,433
But still.

277
00:18:29,135 --> 00:18:30,767
Another wall.

278
00:18:32,469 --> 00:18:33,852
I'm sick and tired

279
00:18:33,936 --> 00:18:35,733
of all these walls.

280
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,452
It's the Armored!

281
00:18:55,536 --> 00:18:57,300
Hurry and kill it!

282
00:19:04,870 --> 00:19:06,467
Fire!

283
00:19:09,802 --> 00:19:11,652
The new Anti-Titan shells...

284
00:19:11,736 --> 00:19:13,734
They can even pierce my armor.

285
00:19:17,135 --> 00:19:19,467
What the...? What hit me?

286
00:19:21,003 --> 00:19:23,767
An armored train.
There's another?

287
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:44,852
Shit!

288
00:19:44,936 --> 00:19:46,200
Fi...

289
00:19:51,402 --> 00:19:52,718
Galliard!

290
00:19:52,802 --> 00:19:54,667
Sons of the devil's whore!

291
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:28,667
It's done.

292
00:20:35,803 --> 00:20:37,867
So the fort's been cleared.

293
00:20:38,602 --> 00:20:42,734
It's our failure that allowed
this war to happen, Reiner.

294
00:20:53,803 --> 00:20:57,200
But every war is awful, don't you agree?

295
00:21:12,002 --> 00:21:14,719
After four long years,

296
00:21:14,803 --> 00:21:16,567
we're about to win the war.

297
00:22:00,536 --> 00:22:02,652
Following the loss of their fleet,

298
00:22:02,736 --> 00:22:04,985
the Mid-East Allied Forces had no choice

299
00:22:05,069 --> 00:22:08,452
but to sign a peace treaty
on Marley's terms.

300
00:22:08,536 --> 00:22:10,918
It was a long, difficult war for Marley,

301
00:22:11,002 --> 00:22:13,318
but it did end in victory.

302
00:22:13,402 --> 00:22:16,786
However, the war also made it
clear to the whole world

303
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:19,985
that the power of Titans
would soon be eclipsed.

304
00:22:20,069 --> 00:22:23,719
Knowing this, the leaders of
Marley would resolve to obtain

305
00:22:23,803 --> 00:22:26,734
the Founding Titan
as quickly as possible.

306
00:22:27,803 --> 00:22:29,800
Oh no.

307
00:22:33,603 --> 00:22:36,586
Thanks to the incomparable
bravery of the Marleyan army,

308
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,852
Fort Slava fell and the
Mid-East fleet was sunk!

309
00:22:38,936 --> 00:22:40,918
Yeah! That's incredible!

310
00:22:41,002 --> 00:22:43,599
I knew our soldiers would pull it off!

311
00:23:40,536 --> 00:23:43,052
Titan strength is not absolute.

312
00:23:43,136 --> 00:23:45,719
Marley was shown this painful reality.

313
00:23:45,802 --> 00:23:48,586
Having secured a moment
of peace through their victory,

314
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:51,719
the Eldians return to
their hometown of Liberio.

315
00:23:51,802 --> 00:23:54,634
Next episode: "Midnight Train."
