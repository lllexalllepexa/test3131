1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:05,829
Falco. Where are you
headed this late?

2
00:00:05,913 --> 00:00:07,429
Left something at HQ,

3
00:00:07,513 --> 00:00:10,429
so I'm running back there
to grab it real quick.

4
00:00:10,513 --> 00:00:11,644
See you later!

5
00:00:17,646 --> 00:00:20,696
Falco, could you do me a favor?

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,744
Sure. What do you need?

7
00:00:23,713 --> 00:00:26,429
I want to send a letter, but

8
00:00:26,513 --> 00:00:28,429
coming from the internment zone,

9
00:00:28,513 --> 00:00:30,029
it'll probably be checked, right?

10
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,629
Yeah, probably.

11
00:00:31,713 --> 00:00:32,829
If they see what I wrote,

12
00:00:32,913 --> 00:00:34,763
they'll know I shouldn't be here.

13
00:00:34,847 --> 00:00:35,897
Would you be willing to send it

14
00:00:35,981 --> 00:00:37,829
from outside the internment zone?

15
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:41,629
Sure thing. Guess this
is to your family?

16
00:00:41,713 --> 00:00:44,563
Yeah. Just letting
them know that I'm here

17
00:00:44,647 --> 00:00:46,577
and that I'm all right.

18
00:02:31,087 --> 00:02:34,669
Hm? Hey. Why all the commotion?

19
00:02:34,753 --> 00:02:36,269
The Tybur family just arrived.

20
00:02:36,353 --> 00:02:37,669
Looks like all of them.

21
00:02:37,753 --> 00:02:39,517
Excuse me?

22
00:02:43,686 --> 00:02:45,269
They're the Tyburs' personal guard.

23
00:02:45,352 --> 00:02:46,936
It's an independent force.

24
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,019
I hear they're good.

25
00:02:49,287 --> 00:02:50,669
Please come in.

26
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,084
Sorry to drop in unannounced.

27
00:02:54,221 --> 00:02:57,803
I'm Willy. Head of
the Tyburs. It's a pleasure.

28
00:02:57,887 --> 00:03:01,003
I lead Marley's Warrior Unit.
Commander Theo Magath.

29
00:03:01,087 --> 00:03:04,602
It is an honor to make your
acquaintance, Lord Tybur.

30
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:06,869
The feeling's mutual, Commander Magath.

31
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:10,069
Now then. Allow me to introduce
you to my beloved family.

32
00:03:10,153 --> 00:03:12,069
I told you to stay still!

33
00:03:12,153 --> 00:03:13,683
Let him go!

34
00:03:15,753 --> 00:03:17,869
Now look what you've done!

35
00:03:17,953 --> 00:03:20,269
You've overseen the
Warrior unit quite successfully,

36
00:03:20,352 --> 00:03:22,736
Commander, so I'm curious.

37
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,869
Can you tell which of us
is the War Hammer Titan?

38
00:03:25,953 --> 00:03:28,669
No, sir. I've seen
no sign at all.

39
00:03:28,753 --> 00:03:29,803
Frankly, I'm not even sure if

40
00:03:29,887 --> 00:03:31,736
the War Hammer came here with you.

41
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:36,602
You have an
astute mind. As I'd heard.

42
00:03:36,686 --> 00:03:38,936
But no. It is here.

43
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,450
Someone among us wields the War Hammer.

44
00:03:48,286 --> 00:03:52,269
I came here to lay eyes
on the statue of Helos.

45
00:03:52,352 --> 00:03:54,669
It captures the moment, a century ago,

46
00:03:54,753 --> 00:03:58,270
when a mere human struck down
the Devil of All Earth,

47
00:03:58,353 --> 00:04:01,018
saving the world and becoming a hero.

48
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:04,069
What a grand sight.

49
00:04:04,153 --> 00:04:07,803
He stands brave and beautiful.
Not a scratch on him.

50
00:04:07,887 --> 00:04:11,003
Truly. This is
the spirit of Marley.

51
00:04:11,087 --> 00:04:12,869
Yes, I agree with you.

52
00:04:12,953 --> 00:04:15,203
Especially since the
statue's completely hollow.

53
00:04:15,286 --> 00:04:19,937
You're an unsparing critic, Commander.

54
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:21,803
I'm told that you've been
working to reinstate

55
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,203
conscription among Marleyan citizens.

56
00:04:24,286 --> 00:04:25,268
To the people of Marley,

57
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:29,269
war exists only in the
pages of their newspapers.

58
00:04:29,353 --> 00:04:32,069
They read words saying
that the border's expanded,

59
00:04:32,153 --> 00:04:33,603
and they feel pride.

60
00:04:33,687 --> 00:04:35,003
If it's our tamed devils,

61
00:04:35,087 --> 00:04:37,003
or conscripts from conquered nations

62
00:04:37,087 --> 00:04:40,203
that bleed for those lands,
so much the better.

63
00:04:40,286 --> 00:04:43,203
I suppose the hope is that
by forcing Marleyan citizens

64
00:04:43,286 --> 00:04:45,269
to risk their own necks in the trenches,

65
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:47,803
then we can eventually
put a halt to this nation's

66
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:50,551
self-destructive march toward war.

67
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,603
But if I had the ear of the man

68
00:04:55,687 --> 00:04:58,003
controlling Marley from the shadows,

69
00:04:58,087 --> 00:05:00,669
I would tell him it's too late.

70
00:05:00,753 --> 00:05:04,869
You truly don't hold back, do you?

71
00:05:04,953 --> 00:05:06,603
What am I to say?

72
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,869
As you just noted,

73
00:05:07,953 --> 00:05:11,003
Marley is under the
Tybur family's influence.

74
00:05:11,087 --> 00:05:14,869
But we did not set Marley
on this path of militarism.

75
00:05:14,953 --> 00:05:17,202
The nation chose that for itself.

76
00:05:17,286 --> 00:05:19,937
Long ago, we Tyburs gave Marley freedom

77
00:05:20,021 --> 00:05:22,803
and power by way of atonement.

78
00:05:22,887 --> 00:05:25,137
We chose to stand by and watch

79
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,217
as this country plunged
itself into darkness.

80
00:05:29,887 --> 00:05:32,202
We intend to reveal
everything to the world

81
00:05:32,286 --> 00:05:34,869
during the main event of the festival.

82
00:05:34,953 --> 00:05:38,603
When I said I'd come to see
the hero's statue, I meant it.

83
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,851
Marley needs a new Helos.

84
00:05:42,087 --> 00:05:43,937
Theo Magath.

85
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:47,151
I ask you to take my hand
and work at my side.

86
00:05:57,353 --> 00:05:58,937
Good morning, Pock!

87
00:05:59,021 --> 00:06:03,536
Hey, Pieck.
Why are you down there?

88
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:06,069
I guess this just feels
more natural to me.

89
00:06:06,152 --> 00:06:08,050
Sorry if I scared you.

90
00:06:08,753 --> 00:06:11,617
Would'ja please just walk normal?

91
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,003
Most Titans come from the south,

92
00:06:14,087 --> 00:06:17,069
so Paradis' defenses are heaviest there,

93
00:06:17,152 --> 00:06:19,803
and comparatively sparse
towards the northern mountains.

94
00:06:19,887 --> 00:06:22,269
I see. So we should
attack from the north.

95
00:06:22,353 --> 00:06:24,536
It's worth considering at least.

96
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,869
However, we need to land a great
many troops and supplies,

97
00:06:27,953 --> 00:06:30,003
and for our largest ships to dock,

98
00:06:30,087 --> 00:06:32,069
we'll need control of
that southern wharf.

99
00:06:32,152 --> 00:06:34,069
Then we should come from the south.

100
00:06:34,152 --> 00:06:35,803
Not necessarily.

101
00:06:35,887 --> 00:06:37,269
We'd be sailing straight to the spot

102
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:39,069
where we lost our scout ships.

103
00:06:39,152 --> 00:06:40,803
Its where the enemy's focused.

104
00:06:40,887 --> 00:06:42,669
They might've even torn the wharf down.

105
00:06:42,753 --> 00:06:45,269
All right. Then what are
you trying to say?

106
00:06:45,353 --> 00:06:47,269
I was just sharing
information that I thought

107
00:06:47,353 --> 00:06:49,069
you might find useful, sir.

108
00:06:49,152 --> 00:06:51,202
Well, I think you've shared quite enough.

109
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:54,584
I don't know why we let an
Eldian talk in the first place.

110
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:02,069
The Paradis plan
seems to be coming right along.

111
00:07:02,152 --> 00:07:06,069
The brass in charge is oh so intelligent.

112
00:07:06,152 --> 00:07:08,803
I sure am excited to hear
what they come up with.

113
00:07:08,887 --> 00:07:10,536
Like entrusting the whole operation

114
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,717
to four children with no support?

115
00:07:15,353 --> 00:07:16,517
Hm?

116
00:07:20,887 --> 00:07:24,451
He's winning.
Falco just passed Gabi.

117
00:07:28,021 --> 00:07:31,603
Heh. Look how they
celebrate that one win.

118
00:07:31,687 --> 00:07:34,869
Dumb kids. Ignorance
really is bliss.

119
00:07:34,953 --> 00:07:36,869
But it doesn't matter how well Falco does

120
00:07:36,953 --> 00:07:38,269
from this point, does it?

121
00:07:38,353 --> 00:07:40,750
I mean Gabi's so far ahead of him.

122
00:07:41,487 --> 00:07:44,003
Did you see how he
took off at the last stretch?

123
00:07:44,086 --> 00:07:46,803
Hey there, kids.
What's all the fuss about?

124
00:07:46,887 --> 00:07:49,269
Falco finally got the best of Gabi!

125
00:07:49,353 --> 00:07:51,603
Really? He beat her grades?

126
00:07:51,687 --> 00:07:53,669
No. He just
outran her in a race.

127
00:07:53,753 --> 00:07:56,068
Sure, but it's still a historic feat!

128
00:07:56,152 --> 00:07:59,536
Hey. Can you cut it out?
Seriously, it's embarrassing.

129
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,068
Pretty impressive!

130
00:08:01,152 --> 00:08:03,884
It sounds like maybe you're
gonna be the next Armor!

131
00:08:05,753 --> 00:08:07,669
There's no point in
trying to beat me now,

132
00:08:07,753 --> 00:08:09,003
it's too little too late!

133
00:08:09,086 --> 00:08:11,003
In case you forgot, I heroically defended

134
00:08:11,086 --> 00:08:12,984
our motherland in battle!

135
00:08:13,953 --> 00:08:17,669
Yeah, I know, but there's still a chance.

136
00:08:17,753 --> 00:08:20,269
They haven't announced
a successor quite yet,

137
00:08:20,353 --> 00:08:23,984
and until they do,
I'll keep on working my hardest.

138
00:08:25,953 --> 00:08:29,603
All right. Said like
a professional Warrior.

139
00:08:29,687 --> 00:08:31,068
Your brother's inheriting the Beast,

140
00:08:31,152 --> 00:08:32,202
so you and your family'll be made

141
00:08:32,286 --> 00:08:34,803
Honorary Marleyans no matter what you do!

142
00:08:34,887 --> 00:08:37,718
You know that, so why try so hard?

143
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,869
I'm doing this for you!

144
00:08:44,953 --> 00:08:46,069
Falco...

145
00:08:46,153 --> 00:08:48,184
He really just up and said it!

146
00:08:51,753 --> 00:08:54,937
Huh?! You're trying to stop me
from getting what I want

147
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,069
but you think you're doing it for me?

148
00:08:57,153 --> 00:08:59,869
That doesn't make any damn sense!

149
00:08:59,953 --> 00:09:02,269
He couldn't get through to her.

150
00:09:02,353 --> 00:09:04,869
Huh? What's that jerk's problem?

151
00:09:04,953 --> 00:09:07,136
Hey! Tell me!

152
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,737
Well if it isn't our brave young

153
00:09:08,821 --> 00:09:10,869
Warriors-in-training.

154
00:09:10,953 --> 00:09:14,136
Gabi!
I heard what you did, Gabi!

155
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,136
You're a hero to all
us Eldians, you know that?

156
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,937
Thanks for your service!

157
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,136
Sorry, but I'm just Zofia.

158
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,669
Huh?

159
00:09:22,753 --> 00:09:23,869
Stop that, you stupid lush!

160
00:09:23,952 --> 00:09:26,202
Between the day-drinking and
the grabbing onto random girls,

161
00:09:26,286 --> 00:09:28,269
I've had it up to here with you!

162
00:09:28,353 --> 00:09:30,603
Shut up, you nosy old bat!

163
00:09:30,687 --> 00:09:32,669
Ain't nothing wrong with
givin' a hero due praise!

164
00:09:32,753 --> 00:09:33,869
There wouldn't be, except getting praised

165
00:09:33,952 --> 00:09:36,002
by someone like you is bad luck!

166
00:09:36,086 --> 00:09:39,017
Now go! Drag yourself home
to your poor mother!

167
00:09:40,887 --> 00:09:44,002
Now. Allow me to give
you kids a nice treat.

168
00:09:44,086 --> 00:09:45,203
Eat up, okay?

169
00:09:45,287 --> 00:09:48,803
I want you to get big and
strong like Vice Chief Braun!

170
00:09:48,887 --> 00:09:50,484
Thank you so much!

171
00:09:53,753 --> 00:09:57,269
Whoa. Are they
really gonna declare war

172
00:09:57,353 --> 00:09:59,669
from here in the internment zone?

173
00:09:59,753 --> 00:10:01,818
Looks like they're building a stage.

174
00:10:02,621 --> 00:10:04,203
They say leaders are gonna come from

175
00:10:04,287 --> 00:10:08,002
all over the world, and by
the time this festival is over,

176
00:10:08,086 --> 00:10:10,936
they're all gonna be on our side.

177
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,284
Fantastic!

178
00:10:13,286 --> 00:10:14,803
Sounds like all of Marley's problems

179
00:10:14,887 --> 00:10:17,002
are about to magically disappear!

180
00:10:17,086 --> 00:10:19,203
You really don't think it'll work?

181
00:10:19,287 --> 00:10:21,136
Do you really think it will?

182
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,737
We've been at war with
too many of these countries.

183
00:10:23,821 --> 00:10:26,002
They want Marley to fall.

184
00:10:26,086 --> 00:10:27,803
We aren't treated well here,

185
00:10:27,886 --> 00:10:30,669
but compared to the hatred
that Eldians face abroad,

186
00:10:30,753 --> 00:10:32,217
we're actually lucky.

187
00:10:32,886 --> 00:10:35,737
My family came from
a foreign internment zone.

188
00:10:35,821 --> 00:10:37,002
It was awful.

189
00:10:37,086 --> 00:10:41,002
Well. That's all the more reason
why we have to do something.

190
00:10:41,086 --> 00:10:43,269
They chose to meet
at the internment zone.

191
00:10:43,353 --> 00:10:45,803
Maybe they wanna help
people understand us.

192
00:10:45,886 --> 00:10:48,803
This is our chance to show the
world that we aren't devils.

193
00:10:48,886 --> 00:10:50,002
Okay, but how?

194
00:10:50,086 --> 00:10:53,202
Smile! I know how
badly you wanna be right,

195
00:10:53,286 --> 00:10:55,202
but right now, you can't be.

196
00:10:55,286 --> 00:10:57,603
Help prove yourself wrong
or we're all screwed.

197
00:10:57,687 --> 00:10:58,868
You shape up, too.

198
00:10:58,952 --> 00:11:01,002
Stop pretending to be a weirdo, Zofia.

199
00:11:01,086 --> 00:11:03,669
Um. This is just who I am.

200
00:11:03,753 --> 00:11:06,737
Fine. So what
are you gonna fix?

201
00:11:06,821 --> 00:11:11,002
Huh? There's nothing for
me to fix, I'm perfect.

202
00:11:11,086 --> 00:11:13,203
I'm sharp as a needle
and cute as a button.

203
00:11:13,287 --> 00:11:15,868
And when I captivate all the VIPs,

204
00:11:15,952 --> 00:11:18,803
my spot's gonna be that much more secure.

205
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:21,203
Are you sure you're not a devil?

206
00:11:21,287 --> 00:11:24,537
And if you two ever cheer
for Falco over me again,

207
00:11:24,621 --> 00:11:25,603
I will make you cry.

208
00:11:25,687 --> 00:11:28,002
Oh, she's definitely a devil.

209
00:11:28,086 --> 00:11:31,737
It's Commander Magath.

210
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,884
Here.

211
00:11:37,153 --> 00:11:39,669
Hmm. Is such a large-scale

212
00:11:39,753 --> 00:11:41,803
demolition necessary?

213
00:11:41,886 --> 00:11:44,817
Much of the structure has
decayed beyond repair.

214
00:11:48,287 --> 00:11:50,203
Allow me to congratulate you.

215
00:11:50,287 --> 00:11:52,603
The army is now yours, General.

216
00:11:52,687 --> 00:11:55,669
No, sir. It belongs
to the nation.

217
00:11:55,753 --> 00:11:57,869
And Marley is a nation commanded

218
00:11:57,953 --> 00:12:00,002
by none other than you, Lord Tybur.

219
00:12:00,086 --> 00:12:03,269
Hm. This nation
isn't mine, though.

220
00:12:03,353 --> 00:12:06,203
It belongs to the people:
Marleyan and Eldian.

221
00:12:06,287 --> 00:12:08,002
Now that I have the wheel,

222
00:12:08,086 --> 00:12:11,669
I can see why no one's
tried to turn it before.

223
00:12:11,753 --> 00:12:13,151
It's too heavy.

224
00:12:14,753 --> 00:12:16,802
I want nothing more than to let it go,

225
00:12:16,886 --> 00:12:20,050
but the time has come when I must not.

226
00:12:21,687 --> 00:12:23,869
It just happened to be me.

227
00:12:23,953 --> 00:12:28,603
By sheer chance, I happened to
be the man that fate turned to.

228
00:12:28,687 --> 00:12:30,869
The house was on the verge of collapse,

229
00:12:30,953 --> 00:12:34,269
but a few of its pillars remain usable.

230
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:39,117
And according to them, the house
is already infested with rats.

231
00:12:41,621 --> 00:12:43,203
Nicely done, Falco.

232
00:12:43,287 --> 00:12:45,936
It's thanks to what
you said, Mr. Kruger!

233
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:48,203
Honestly, I doubt I'll catch up to Gabi,

234
00:12:48,287 --> 00:12:50,869
no matter how hard I push myself.

235
00:12:50,953 --> 00:12:54,069
But even so, I'm gonna
keep moving forward.

236
00:12:54,153 --> 00:12:56,203
I see.

237
00:12:56,287 --> 00:12:59,269
I would still say that
I'm in your debt though.

238
00:12:59,353 --> 00:13:03,269
Thank you for delivering
those letters for me.

239
00:13:03,353 --> 00:13:04,802
You've been a big help.

240
00:13:04,886 --> 00:13:07,117
Huh? Oh, sure.

241
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,002
That glove. Did your
family send it to you?

242
00:13:12,086 --> 00:13:15,802
They thought it would make
hospital life less boring.

243
00:13:15,886 --> 00:13:19,203
It's hard to do much in this shape, but

244
00:13:19,287 --> 00:13:21,936
I need to move forward, too.

245
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:25,784
After the festival,
I'm going back to my hometown.

246
00:13:27,087 --> 00:13:29,269
Glad to hear it.

247
00:13:29,353 --> 00:13:32,003
A doctor's coming.

248
00:13:32,087 --> 00:13:33,869
Well. I should head out.

249
00:13:33,953 --> 00:13:34,950
Yeah.

250
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,802
Would you mind if I sit next to you?

251
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,618
Sure. Why not?

252
00:13:42,487 --> 00:13:44,817
Thanks, I appreciate it.

253
00:13:47,287 --> 00:13:50,136
My name's Jaeger. I'm an
Internment Zone physician.

254
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,003
I like to come out here and
drink tea from time to time.

255
00:13:54,087 --> 00:13:57,670
Good to meet you. I'm Kruger.

256
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,269
Good to meet you, too.

257
00:13:59,353 --> 00:14:03,603
I saw you speaking with a boy
just now. Is he a friend?

258
00:14:03,686 --> 00:14:04,869
Guess so.

259
00:14:04,953 --> 00:14:08,802
Hmm. I wonder
if he could've been my friend.

260
00:14:08,886 --> 00:14:12,817
After all, I too sit here,
looking for someone to talk to.

261
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:16,269
Before the Eldian
Restorationists were caught,

262
00:14:16,353 --> 00:14:19,069
that boy's uncle was a leading member.

263
00:14:19,153 --> 00:14:21,069
Marley sends captured restorationists

264
00:14:21,153 --> 00:14:22,002
straight to paradise,

265
00:14:22,086 --> 00:14:24,869
frequently with their family's in tow.

266
00:14:24,953 --> 00:14:26,669
In order to protect their loved ones,

267
00:14:26,753 --> 00:14:30,002
the boy and his brother said
they wanted to become Warriors.

268
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:32,069
And now, his brother has been chosen

269
00:14:32,153 --> 00:14:34,069
to inherit the Beast Titan.

270
00:14:34,153 --> 00:14:38,084
Which means the Grice family
is finally safe again.

271
00:14:39,287 --> 00:14:43,003
Hold on. Why tell me all this?

272
00:14:43,087 --> 00:14:45,003
So that you'll stop asking that young man

273
00:14:45,087 --> 00:14:47,003
to run errands for you.

274
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:49,736
The Grice family's efforts
will have been for nothing

275
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,802
if people begin to suspect
him of something illicit.

276
00:14:52,886 --> 00:14:55,802
And if your heart and mind
truly are healthy,

277
00:14:55,886 --> 00:14:58,736
you should go back to your family now.

278
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,203
The people you love
won't always be waiting.

279
00:15:01,287 --> 00:15:04,984
If you take them for granted,
you will be left with regret.

280
00:15:06,287 --> 00:15:08,717
Will I? I see.

281
00:15:12,087 --> 00:15:15,350
You have regrets about your own family?

282
00:15:17,753 --> 00:15:20,537
I'm filled with them. Even now.

283
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,269
I was so hard on my son.

284
00:15:22,353 --> 00:15:25,069
So insistent that he become a doctor.

285
00:15:25,153 --> 00:15:28,537
That's why he took his sister
outside the walls.

286
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,269
That's why she...

287
00:15:30,353 --> 00:15:31,403
She...

288
00:15:31,487 --> 00:15:36,550
It's
my fault. It's all my fault!

289
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,269
Mr. Jaeger!

290
00:15:43,353 --> 00:15:45,802
Please don't go outside unsupervised!

291
00:15:45,886 --> 00:15:49,084
Sorry about this. I only
looked away for a moment.

292
00:15:50,087 --> 00:15:52,269
Come along, Mr. Jaeger.

293
00:15:52,353 --> 00:15:54,817
Everything will be all right.

294
00:16:13,785 --> 00:16:14,701
This is crazy.

295
00:16:14,785 --> 00:16:17,100
I've seen these people in the papers.

296
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,167
Enough idle chitchat.

297
00:16:19,251 --> 00:16:21,767
We're gonna serve these people
so well that their heads spin.

298
00:16:21,851 --> 00:16:23,767
Look, they're starting
to leave dirty dishes.

299
00:16:23,851 --> 00:16:24,982
Get 'em!

300
00:16:28,184 --> 00:16:29,301
Yes.

301
00:16:29,385 --> 00:16:31,182
I've always felt that way.

302
00:16:33,518 --> 00:16:34,567
Falco, drink!

303
00:16:34,651 --> 00:16:35,483
Here!

304
00:16:37,651 --> 00:16:42,567
Huh? Look. They're letting some
filthy-blood carry our plates.

305
00:16:42,651 --> 00:16:46,549
Ugh. No wonder
the food here reeks.

306
00:16:50,518 --> 00:16:52,501
I-I'm terribly sorry, ma'am!

307
00:16:52,585 --> 00:16:54,767
Shh! Don't make a scene of it.

308
00:16:54,851 --> 00:16:57,634
But the wine.
It stained your outfit.

309
00:16:57,718 --> 00:17:01,167
My lady. Is everything
all right?

310
00:17:01,251 --> 00:17:04,434
This is quite embarrassing,
but I spilled wine on my kimono

311
00:17:04,518 --> 00:17:07,367
and was just asking
this boy for assistance.

312
00:17:07,451 --> 00:17:08,367
Thank you, young man.

313
00:17:08,451 --> 00:17:10,367
I'm so sorry to hear that.

314
00:17:10,451 --> 00:17:12,034
Please come right this way.

315
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:14,167
Wh-Why would you...?

316
00:17:14,251 --> 00:17:15,701
There's no telling what
they would've done to you

317
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:17,649
if I'd been honest, right?

318
00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:20,501
Are you okay?

319
00:17:20,585 --> 00:17:23,767
Yeah. She saved me.

320
00:17:23,851 --> 00:17:26,501
Even though she knew that I'm an Eldian.

321
00:17:26,585 --> 00:17:28,634
I think I know why.

322
00:17:28,718 --> 00:17:32,282
That woman's probably
an Easterner from Hizuru.

323
00:17:36,384 --> 00:17:38,082
It's Willy Tybur!

324
00:17:39,318 --> 00:17:40,701
Willy!

325
00:17:40,785 --> 00:17:43,167
If it isn't the heir of our saviors!

326
00:17:43,251 --> 00:17:46,367
Ambassador Ogweno!
Long time no see!

327
00:17:46,451 --> 00:17:49,567
And Nambia! It's been
since we were children.

328
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:52,701
Yes. Sorry for
all the times I made you cry.

329
00:17:52,785 --> 00:17:55,034
I wonder if you remember this, Willy.

330
00:17:55,118 --> 00:17:58,315
Oh! Of course, from when
you fell out of that tree!

331
00:18:03,719 --> 00:18:06,034
Let me bid you a warm welcome

332
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:09,434
and offer my thanks to
you all for traveling so far.

333
00:18:09,518 --> 00:18:12,367
Until very recently,
some of us were engaged

334
00:18:12,451 --> 00:18:16,301
in a rather unseemly
dispute over resources.

335
00:18:16,385 --> 00:18:19,948
However, yesterday's enemy
is today's enemy!

336
00:18:20,785 --> 00:18:21,767
Pardon.

337
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:24,635
I mean yesterday's enemy
is today's friend!

338
00:18:24,719 --> 00:18:26,367
Let us wash the past down the toilet

339
00:18:26,451 --> 00:18:29,167
alongside our drinks tonight!

340
00:18:29,251 --> 00:18:30,767
Toward that end,
please raise your glasses

341
00:18:30,851 --> 00:18:32,701
and join me for a toast!

342
00:18:32,785 --> 00:18:35,716
Cheers! To everlasting peace!

343
00:18:37,651 --> 00:18:40,034
Such a refined joke!

344
00:18:40,118 --> 00:18:42,100
It's unfortunate that
this isn't a first language

345
00:18:42,184 --> 00:18:43,767
for all our guests.

346
00:18:43,851 --> 00:18:45,501
You weren't quite understood.

347
00:18:45,585 --> 00:18:47,701
So please, allow me
to take over from here.

348
00:18:47,785 --> 00:18:50,034
Thanks for breaking the ice, Ambassador.

349
00:18:50,118 --> 00:18:51,434
All right, Willy!

350
00:18:51,518 --> 00:18:53,515
Kin of our saviors!

351
00:18:57,318 --> 00:18:59,701
You've been invited to join me tomorrow,

352
00:18:59,785 --> 00:19:02,100
in the Liberio Internment Zone.

353
00:19:02,184 --> 00:19:06,181
It is home to a people whose
blood runs through my own veins.

354
00:19:07,118 --> 00:19:10,167
These people are known
to be descendants of devils,

355
00:19:10,251 --> 00:19:14,034
for their ancestors
massacred untold millions.

356
00:19:14,118 --> 00:19:17,301
And strangely, after enduring
the worst of their cruelty,

357
00:19:17,385 --> 00:19:20,367
Marley used those devils
to oppress other nations,

358
00:19:20,451 --> 00:19:23,234
repeating the horrors of the past.

359
00:19:23,318 --> 00:19:27,434
Would the world not be better
if Titans ceased to exist?

360
00:19:27,518 --> 00:19:30,767
There is but one answer
to the Eldian question.

361
00:19:30,850 --> 00:19:34,034
After years of searching, I've found it.

362
00:19:34,118 --> 00:19:36,100
And tomorrow night, I'll share it

363
00:19:36,184 --> 00:19:38,767
in the course of my first-ever
theatrical production.

364
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:41,501
I hope that each of you will be there.

365
00:19:41,585 --> 00:19:45,367
Now. To the playwrights
and the witnesses of history!

366
00:19:45,451 --> 00:19:48,682
To the playwrights
and the witnesses of history!

367
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,448
What the hell?

368
00:20:16,451 --> 00:20:18,167
What is all this?

369
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:19,367
Gabi!

370
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:20,367
About time you woke up!

371
00:20:20,451 --> 00:20:22,167
Why is everything all crazy?

372
00:20:22,251 --> 00:20:23,501
It's for the festival!

373
00:20:23,585 --> 00:20:24,701
Different people have been pouring in

374
00:20:24,784 --> 00:20:26,367
from outside all morning,

375
00:20:26,451 --> 00:20:28,101
and they opened up
a bunch of food stalls!

376
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:29,615
Here, try this!

377
00:20:30,518 --> 00:20:32,567
It's the best thing I've ever tasted!

378
00:20:32,651 --> 00:20:34,149
Let's go!

379
00:21:01,385 --> 00:21:04,101
Ugh. It hurts!

380
00:21:04,185 --> 00:21:07,435
That's what you get for being a glutton.

381
00:21:07,519 --> 00:21:09,167
Look at the flags they put up!

382
00:21:09,251 --> 00:21:12,167
They should just
make every day a festival.

383
00:21:12,251 --> 00:21:13,367
Think so, huh?

384
00:21:13,451 --> 00:21:16,100
It probably  nothing, but I've
noticed a lot of new things

385
00:21:16,184 --> 00:21:18,367
have been happening in the last few days.

386
00:21:18,451 --> 00:21:20,234
Is that right?

387
00:21:20,318 --> 00:21:21,701
It feels strange.

388
00:21:21,784 --> 00:21:25,567
As if the world is about to
change in a big way.

389
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:28,182
Yeah. I hear you.

390
00:22:33,846 --> 00:22:36,562
Hey. How've you
enjoyed the festival?

391
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,695
Wait. Where's Falco?

392
00:22:38,779 --> 00:22:41,430
Oh. He said he saw someone
he knew in the crowd

393
00:22:41,514 --> 00:22:42,762
and ran off to say hi.

394
00:22:42,846 --> 00:22:45,496
Huh. Hope this doesn't
make him late.

395
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,362
Man. You really can't loosen up

396
00:22:47,446 --> 00:22:49,162
without booze, can you?

397
00:22:49,246 --> 00:22:50,562
Look at all these people.

398
00:22:50,646 --> 00:22:52,762
Look there. I guess
he made it back.

399
00:22:52,846 --> 00:22:55,296
Mr. Braun!

400
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,029
Where the hell have you been?

401
00:22:57,113 --> 00:22:59,562
Sir. Do you mind coming with me?

402
00:22:59,646 --> 00:23:00,762
Don't think there's time.

403
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:02,362
Ah, you'll be fine.

404
00:23:02,446 --> 00:23:05,562
The curtains won't go up
for a few more minutes.

405
00:23:05,645 --> 00:23:07,296
Over this way!

406
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,362
What's this about, Falco?

407
00:23:09,446 --> 00:23:11,477
You can see for yourself in a second.

408
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:17,762
It's through this door!

409
00:23:17,846 --> 00:23:19,210
okay...

410
00:23:22,779 --> 00:23:24,477
I got him to come!

411
00:23:26,246 --> 00:23:31,977
Evening. It's been
four years... Reiner.

412
00:23:35,846 --> 00:23:37,144
Eren!

413
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:44,496
Reiner faces Eren in
the gloom of a lamplit cellar.

414
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,762
As Willy Tybur sweeps
his audience to their feet,

415
00:23:47,846 --> 00:23:49,362
Eren confesses.

416
00:23:49,446 --> 00:23:52,029
He and Reiner are the same.

417
00:23:52,113 --> 00:23:55,144
Next episode:
"Declaration of War."
