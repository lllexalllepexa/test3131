00:10:23,337 --> 00:10:26,957
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}I counted about 500 free

107
00:10:32,337 --> 00:10:35,677

110

111
00:10:42,687 --> 00:10:45,397
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}There must be some reason

112
00:10:45,477 --> 00:10:48,317
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}So I'm guessing that there's

00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,197

<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}It's possible.

126
00:11:23,687 --> 00:11:26,147
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}This might be the explanation.

127
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,277
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}If it is, then Zeke's

00:11:31,487 --> 00:11:34,777
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}We have to prevent the two

132

<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}It'll all be for nothing!

244
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:42,917
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}You have to believe me.

245
00:18:46,547 --> 00:18:47,707
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}He's telling the truth.

246
00:18:47,797 --> 00:18:49,217
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}Armin?

247
00:18:49,297 --> 00:18:51,757
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}Years ago, when you
first came here,

248
00:18:51,837 --> 00:18:53,587
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}you said something
that stuck with me.

249
00:18:53,677 --> 00:18:57,177
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}That we Subjects of Ymir
exist because we're wanted.

250
00:18:57,257 --> 00:18:58,387
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}That the world
is more interesting

251
00:18:58,477 --> 00:19:00,597
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}with different kinds of people.

252
00:19:00,687 --> 00:19:02,137
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}I think you believe that.

253
00:19:02,227 --> 00:19:05,227
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}And I think that belief goes
against everything Zeke's doing.

254
00:19:05,317 --> 00:19:07,987
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}You meant all the things
you said, right?

255
00:19:08,067 --> 00:19:11,237
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}Then get back on
your feet. Onyankopon.

256
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,697
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}Thank you.

257
00:19:15,197 --> 00:19:17,617
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}Well, for what it's worth,
I believe you, too.

258
00:19:17,697 --> 00:19:19,117
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}But now what?

259
00:19:19,197 --> 00:19:21,577
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}If we help Eren and Zeke
fight off the Marleyan army,

260
00:19:21,667 --> 00:19:22,827
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}they'll just end up
going through with

261
00:19:22,917 --> 00:19:25,127
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}the euthanization plan, right?

262
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:28,087
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}Well. We'll at least have
a chance to stop them.

263
00:19:28,957 --> 00:19:31,087
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}Because if those two die,

264
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:33,387
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}the whole world is gonna
come crashing down on us.

265
00:19:33,467 --> 00:19:35,507
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}[CONNY] So what are you trying
to say we should do, then?

266
00:19:35,597 --> 00:19:37,387
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}If nothing else, we can
activate the rumbling

267
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:40,307
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}and show the world that we're
capable of punching back!

268
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:43,267
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}[CONNY] Huh? You wanna give 'em
a taste of the rumbling?

269
00:19:43,347 --> 00:19:46,107
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}Hey, Mikasa, what do you think?

270
00:19:46,187 --> 00:19:48,107
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}Do you want to go help Eren?


271
00:19:53,737 --> 00:19:59,487
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}I would say yes. Except, knowing what he told me,

272
00:19:59,577 --> 00:20:04,707
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}I'm not sure if I want to or if
my blood is telling me to.

273
00:20:06,077 --> 00:20:08,167
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}[MIKASA]
I'm an Ackerman.

274
00:20:08,247 --> 00:20:10,547
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}My will's not my own.

275
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:12,167
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}Huh?

276
00:20:12,257 --> 00:20:13,797
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}Look, Mikasa.

277
00:20:13,877 --> 00:20:16,797
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}I think Eren made that up
to mess with your head.

278
00:20:17,757 --> 00:20:19,467
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}No, he was on to something.

279
00:20:19,557 --> 00:20:22,267
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}He asked if I get
headaches, and I do.

280
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:24,437
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}What makes you
think he was lying?

281
00:20:24,517 --> 00:20:26,097
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}What makes me think h―

282
00:20:26,187 --> 00:20:27,607
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}Guys.

283
00:20:27,687 --> 00:20:29,397
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}Do you actually
believe Eren wants to

284
00:20:29,477 --> 00:20:31,817
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}stop all Eldians
from having children?

285
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,607
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}You honestly think
he'd go along with that?

286
00:20:39,027 --> 00:20:41,367
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}It doesn't really strike me
as something Eren would want,

287
00:20:41,447 --> 00:20:43,747
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}but I can't say that it's
more than he's willing―

288
00:20:43,827 --> 00:20:45,077
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}Well I can say it!

289
00:20:45,157 --> 00:20:46,457
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}He would never do that!

290
00:20:46,537 --> 00:20:47,707
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}You don't think so?

291
00:20:47,787 --> 00:20:49,537
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}Did you think he'd work
with Zeke and Yelena?

292
00:20:49,627 --> 00:20:51,917
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}He's just pretending to!
Don't you see?

293
00:20:51,997 --> 00:20:53,967
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}Eren's the one with
the Founding Titan's power,

294
00:20:54,047 --> 00:20:56,297
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}so he doesn't
need to fight Zeke!

295
00:20:56,387 --> 00:20:57,507
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}Things were different
when Yelena

296
00:20:57,587 --> 00:20:59,047
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}first came to him with the plan.

297
00:20:59,137 --> 00:21:00,547
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}There's no telling
what she might have done

298
00:21:00,637 --> 00:21:02,427
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}if he had refused to join her.

299
00:21:02,517 --> 00:21:04,807
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}He didn't have
any options back then!

300
00:21:04,887 --> 00:21:06,937
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}But now, Eren has Yelena
completely convinced

301
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:08,767
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}that he's on her side,
and the Volunteers have

302
00:21:08,847 --> 00:21:11,277
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}gotten him in contact with Zeke.

303
00:21:11,357 --> 00:21:12,647
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}He's in control.

304
00:21:12,727 --> 00:21:15,527
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size=55>{\an20}He can use the rumbling
to protect the island!

00:21:15,607 --> 00:21:19,987
