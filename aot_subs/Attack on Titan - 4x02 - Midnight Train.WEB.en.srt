1
00:00:01,372 --> 00:00:03,488
We wasted four years squabbling over

2
00:00:03,572 --> 00:00:06,288
some peninsula's sovereignty,
and in the end,

3
00:00:06,372 --> 00:00:08,755
our two main Battle Titans
were nearly shredded

4
00:00:08,839 --> 00:00:11,755
by the guns of the enemy fleet.

5
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:14,288
"The weapons of mankind
have at last grown

6
00:00:14,372 --> 00:00:18,221
strong enough to
sunder Marley's armor."

7
00:00:18,305 --> 00:00:20,822
Headlines the world over
hold up this battle

8
00:00:20,906 --> 00:00:22,756
as proof of our weakness.

9
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:25,622
So we can't truly call it
a victory for our nation,

10
00:00:25,706 --> 00:00:26,822
now can we?

11
00:00:26,906 --> 00:00:27,822
Well? Speak.

12
00:00:27,906 --> 00:00:29,822
What do you make of this, Magath?

13
00:00:29,906 --> 00:00:31,288
Frankly, General,

14
00:00:31,372 --> 00:00:33,688
we knew this day would come, and it has.

15
00:00:33,772 --> 00:00:36,155
The power of the Titans
has been surpassed.

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:37,756
Our time's run out.

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,422
We've been content to rely
on the power of the Titans

18
00:00:40,506 --> 00:00:43,355
as we expand our colonial holdings.

19
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,288
Meanwhile, countries that
lacked Titans to rely on

20
00:00:46,372 --> 00:00:48,355
developed weapons to oppose them.

21
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:52,422
And now, our complacency
is about to bite us in the ass.

22
00:00:52,506 --> 00:00:54,488
When it comes to ground engagements,

23
00:00:54,572 --> 00:00:58,622
our Titan forces should
reign supreme for a while yet.

24
00:00:58,706 --> 00:01:02,221
That said, if aircraft
keep advancing at this rate,

25
00:01:02,305 --> 00:01:05,488
they will soon make bombs
rain from the sky.

26
00:01:05,572 --> 00:01:09,888
And when that time comes,
Titans, the devils of the earth,

27
00:01:09,972 --> 00:01:12,603
will only be able to look up and watch.

28
00:01:16,772 --> 00:01:19,603
We don't have any Titans
with wings, do we?

29
00:01:20,639 --> 00:01:21,822
Please, General.

30
00:01:21,906 --> 00:01:23,688
What I'm saying is that we
can no longer depend on...

31
00:01:23,772 --> 00:01:25,688
The Titans, yes.

32
00:01:25,772 --> 00:01:29,355
As a result, our global military
dominance will soon falter.

33
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,422
Or, we've lost our grip on it already.

34
00:01:32,506 --> 00:01:34,688
It's funny. We've gone
from the nation of heroes

35
00:01:34,772 --> 00:01:39,488
who crushed the Eldian Devils,
to whatever the hell we are now.

36
00:01:39,572 --> 00:01:41,756
Begging your pardon, General.

37
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,288
If you'd forgive my boldness.

38
00:01:43,372 --> 00:01:44,688
I have some thoughts on this.

39
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:48,302
Ah, Zeke the boy wonder.
Go right ahead.

40
00:01:48,972 --> 00:01:51,822
It's time we resumed
the Paradis Operation,

41
00:01:51,906 --> 00:01:54,737
so that we can take control
of the Founding Titan.

42
00:01:56,372 --> 00:01:58,422
It's just as Commander Magath was saying.

43
00:01:58,506 --> 00:01:59,688
We must adapt.

44
00:01:59,772 --> 00:02:03,288
Marley will need to modernize
her military, starting now.

45
00:02:03,372 --> 00:02:05,422
However, the world will not stand by

46
00:02:05,506 --> 00:02:07,069
and wait for her to do it.

47
00:02:07,906 --> 00:02:09,888
Reforming the army will take time.

48
00:02:09,971 --> 00:02:12,555
And the best way to buy that
time is by giving the newspapers

49
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:14,488
of the world a new headline to publish.

50
00:02:14,572 --> 00:02:16,221
Something like this:

51
00:02:16,305 --> 00:02:18,422
"Marley defeats the devils of Paradis

52
00:02:18,506 --> 00:02:20,822
and seizes the power
of all nine Titans."

53
00:02:20,906 --> 00:02:22,636
Hmm.

54
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:26,888
Forgive the reminder, but won't
your term be up in a year?

55
00:02:26,971 --> 00:02:30,288
Yes. And I'm quite anxious
about whether or not

56
00:02:30,372 --> 00:02:33,503
Colt can inherit the full
power of the Beast Titan.

57
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,822
Ah, I get it.

58
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,555
You wish to use your last
year to redeem yourself.

59
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:42,888
You don't want to die with
unfinished business, is that it?

60
00:02:42,971 --> 00:02:45,288
You understand me completely.

61
00:02:45,372 --> 00:02:46,822
My father, Grisha Jeagar,

62
00:02:46,906 --> 00:02:50,355
set something great and terrible
in motion on that island.

63
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,756
And as his former son,

64
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,968
I would like to be the end of it.

65
00:04:35,756 --> 00:04:37,404
Sorry for insulting your competence

66
00:04:37,488 --> 00:04:39,405
to further my agenda, Colt.

67
00:04:39,489 --> 00:04:41,405
No, I'm glad you did.

68
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,005
Seeing all those officers listening

69
00:04:43,089 --> 00:04:45,120
to an Eldian was amazing.

70
00:04:47,023 --> 00:04:48,005
And you're right.

71
00:04:48,089 --> 00:04:50,805
There hasn't been a Beast
like you in history.

72
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:53,287
Your Beast is like
a second Founding Titan.

73
00:04:54,756 --> 00:04:56,939
What makes you so special, Zeke?

74
00:04:57,023 --> 00:05:00,205
It's not like you have
royal blood in your veins.

75
00:05:00,289 --> 00:05:01,404
Who can say?

76
00:05:01,488 --> 00:05:04,672
Chances are, I'll be dead
before we can figure it out.

77
00:05:04,756 --> 00:05:07,405
Oh, but since you'll
inherit the Beast from me,

78
00:05:07,489 --> 00:05:10,872
you'll see my memories,
and learn my secret.

79
00:05:10,956 --> 00:05:13,005
Your secret? About what?

80
00:05:13,089 --> 00:05:16,338
The way I wipe my ass.
It's real special.

81
00:05:16,422 --> 00:05:17,805
Hope you don't tell anyone.

82
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:20,005
Too late. I want a full report.

83
00:05:20,089 --> 00:05:21,139
Commander!

84
00:05:21,223 --> 00:05:22,005
You tell me everything,

85
00:05:22,089 --> 00:05:24,739
down to the number of hairs on your ass.

86
00:05:24,823 --> 00:05:26,805
Do you think Eldians deserve privacy?

87
00:05:26,889 --> 00:05:28,753
Certainly not, sir.

88
00:05:32,157 --> 00:05:35,073
So you believe you can
conquer Paradis in a year?

89
00:05:35,157 --> 00:05:36,672
All that I can say for a fact

90
00:05:36,756 --> 00:05:39,405
is that I only have
a year left to try, sir.

91
00:05:39,489 --> 00:05:42,338
In the past three years,
that island has swallowed up

92
00:05:42,422 --> 00:05:45,405
every survey ship we've
sent to it: No survivors.

93
00:05:45,489 --> 00:05:48,405
Tell me. What do you
make of that, Zeke?

94
00:05:48,489 --> 00:05:52,205
Considering the fact that none
of those 32 ships have returned,

95
00:05:52,289 --> 00:05:53,805
I think it's clear that
we're dealing with

96
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:55,073
more than one Titan.

97
00:05:55,157 --> 00:05:57,805
My best guess is that Eren coordinated

98
00:05:57,889 --> 00:05:59,338
with the Colossal or Female.

99
00:05:59,422 --> 00:06:02,073
Sinking our ships while
blocking their escape.

100
00:06:02,157 --> 00:06:03,672
A fair assessment.

101
00:06:03,756 --> 00:06:05,872
Our ships won't be able
to land on the island

102
00:06:05,956 --> 00:06:07,205
without heavy support.

103
00:06:07,288 --> 00:06:09,939
Right. And we'd
do well to remember.

104
00:06:10,023 --> 00:06:12,820
It isn't just their Titans
that pose a threat.

105
00:06:18,288 --> 00:06:19,620
Wait...!

106
00:06:24,089 --> 00:06:27,005
Sounded like you were
having an extra sweet dream,

107
00:06:27,089 --> 00:06:29,405
so I thought I'd let you enjoy it.

108
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:32,405
You saved my life at Fort Slava.

109
00:06:32,489 --> 00:06:35,087
Thanks, Galliard. I owe you.

110
00:06:36,288 --> 00:06:38,805
Don't want your thanks.

111
00:06:38,889 --> 00:06:41,805
If I had inherited the
Armored Titan nine years ago,

112
00:06:41,889 --> 00:06:43,953
then none of this would've happened.

113
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:47,205
My brother would still be alive,

114
00:06:47,288 --> 00:06:50,205
'cause he wouldn't have gotten
eaten trying to protect you.

115
00:06:50,288 --> 00:06:52,205
So you've seen Marcel's memories?

116
00:06:52,288 --> 00:06:55,405
I haven't, but I learned what I needed to

117
00:06:55,489 --> 00:06:58,739
from my predecessor, Ymir.

118
00:06:58,823 --> 00:07:04,139
An ironically grand name
for such a pitiful woman.

119
00:07:04,222 --> 00:07:05,672
She basically volunteered

120
00:07:05,756 --> 00:07:08,005
to give my brother's
jaws back. Right?

121
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:10,805
Yeah. She did.

122
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:14,073
What did you even do
on that island anyway?

123
00:07:14,157 --> 00:07:17,005
Stumble around finding
people to save you?

124
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:18,005
Yeah.

125
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:20,338
I saw you through her memories.

126
00:07:20,422 --> 00:07:23,405
You acted like you were
the tough, reliable type.

127
00:07:23,489 --> 00:07:26,005
Not at all like yourself.

128
00:07:26,089 --> 00:07:28,805
Did you think you could
fill my brother's shoes?

129
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:31,205
Pock. We shouldn't
pick on people

130
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:33,405
who've been hit by artillery.

131
00:07:33,489 --> 00:07:36,005
That's not my name,
Pieck. Stop it.

132
00:07:36,089 --> 00:07:37,204
How are you?

133
00:07:37,288 --> 00:07:40,672
It's been about two months since
the last time I was human.

134
00:07:40,756 --> 00:07:44,139
Kinda forgot how the
whole bipedal thing works.

135
00:07:44,222 --> 00:07:45,805
By the way, Reiner.

136
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:47,805
You oughta visit Gabi and the others.

137
00:07:47,889 --> 00:07:50,073
They're worried about you.

138
00:07:50,157 --> 00:07:52,353
Right, will do.

139
00:07:55,157 --> 00:07:59,204
I'm pooped.

140
00:07:59,288 --> 00:08:01,805
Feels like I haven't seen you in forever.

141
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:05,873
Really? Even though we're
always fighting side by side?

142
00:08:05,957 --> 00:08:08,987
Well, we shouldn't have to for a while.

143
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,887
We can hope.

144
00:08:14,422 --> 00:08:15,204
This way.

145
00:08:15,288 --> 00:08:16,587
Sure.

146
00:08:17,756 --> 00:08:22,204
Hey, uh. If Titans
become obsolete soon,

147
00:08:22,288 --> 00:08:23,873
what will that mean for us?

148
00:08:23,957 --> 00:08:26,253
If Eldians lose their use, then...

149
00:08:28,957 --> 00:08:30,138
I was talking to my neighbor...

150
00:08:30,222 --> 00:08:31,939
Mr. Braun will be fine.

151
00:08:32,023 --> 00:08:33,939
Yeah, I know.

152
00:08:34,023 --> 00:08:36,020
Look.

153
00:08:38,356 --> 00:08:40,138
They're enemy soldiers.

154
00:08:40,222 --> 00:08:43,405
Probably survivors of
the Pure Titan attack.

155
00:08:43,489 --> 00:08:45,338
And once they get
back home, they'll become

156
00:08:45,422 --> 00:08:48,405
living proof of how
inhumane Titan warfare is.

157
00:08:48,489 --> 00:08:49,338
Every time this happens,

158
00:08:49,422 --> 00:08:52,073
it makes us Eldians
look more like monsters!

159
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,338
"Good people of the world!

160
00:08:53,422 --> 00:08:56,020
Let us wipe out
the Subjects of Ymir!"

161
00:08:58,156 --> 00:09:00,672
Shit! Shit! Shit!

162
00:09:00,756 --> 00:09:04,805
Udo, stop.
Don't hit town property.

163
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:09,138
Reiner! So.
You're good to walk again?

164
00:09:09,222 --> 00:09:12,854
Yeah. What about
all of you? Gabi?

165
00:09:14,222 --> 00:09:16,272
- -Udo.
- -I guess.

166
00:09:16,356 --> 00:09:17,138
Zofia.

167
00:09:17,222 --> 00:09:18,653
I'm all right.

168
00:09:19,489 --> 00:09:21,939
- -Falco.
- -Hello.

169
00:09:22,023 --> 00:09:23,405
Hey! Did you hear?

170
00:09:23,489 --> 00:09:26,005
They're gonna take us
all back to Liberio soon!

171
00:09:26,088 --> 00:09:27,939
Come on, we can explore town until then.

172
00:09:28,023 --> 00:09:28,739
Wait...

173
00:09:28,823 --> 00:09:30,005
We never get chances like this...

174
00:09:30,088 --> 00:09:33,253
Mr. Braun's healing, he prob'ly
needs to go back to bed soon.

175
00:09:36,289 --> 00:09:38,338
I'm all right. Don't worry.

176
00:09:38,422 --> 00:09:40,338
Maybe you should go back to bed.

177
00:09:40,422 --> 00:09:42,672
No, I'm coming with you guys.

178
00:09:42,756 --> 00:09:44,405
Hey, wait! Commander Magath said

179
00:09:44,489 --> 00:09:46,205
that place is only for lonely adults.

180
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:49,020
Are you sure? 'Cause I
just saw him go in.

181
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,886
Don't worry so much.

182
00:09:57,757 --> 00:09:58,887
Wait!

183
00:10:05,088 --> 00:10:07,805
You kids are too young to go in there.

184
00:10:07,889 --> 00:10:09,687
Aww.

185
00:10:14,088 --> 00:10:15,672
Who else saw it?

186
00:10:15,756 --> 00:10:17,205
How many of you witnessed the courage

187
00:10:17,289 --> 00:10:19,205
of our Eldian goddess here?

188
00:10:19,289 --> 00:10:20,939
She took on an armored train.

189
00:10:21,023 --> 00:10:21,805
And she did it alone,

190
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:23,672
in the place of 800 Eldian soldiers!

191
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:26,005
How drunk are you?
Your breath's awful.

192
00:10:26,088 --> 00:10:28,686
C'mon, ya big dummy,
tell 'em why ya did it!

193
00:10:29,623 --> 00:10:31,873
Comrades! Do you have
any idea why this idiot

194
00:10:31,957 --> 00:10:35,072
risked her life to destroy that train?

195
00:10:35,156 --> 00:10:36,739
All right, I'll say it then!

196
00:10:36,823 --> 00:10:37,939
She did it for all of you!

197
00:10:38,022 --> 00:10:41,687
To save your sorry Eldian asses
from the enemy's bullets!

198
00:10:46,489 --> 00:10:49,004
I'll go shut 'em up.

199
00:10:49,088 --> 00:10:50,820
Let's look the other way.

200
00:10:51,823 --> 00:10:53,405
Give 'em this one night.

201
00:10:53,489 --> 00:10:55,405
Gabi! Gabi! Gabi!

202
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:59,205
I'm the best!
I'm the best! I'm the best!

203
00:10:59,289 --> 00:11:01,805
Not the first time
I've seen her up there.

204
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:04,805
I really wish they'd stop
letting my brother drink.

205
00:11:04,889 --> 00:11:07,673
And Gabi gets carried away too easily.

206
00:11:07,757 --> 00:11:10,338
That said, if she keeps
on performing at the level

207
00:11:10,422 --> 00:11:13,405
she has been, she'll get the Armor.

208
00:11:13,489 --> 00:11:16,873
Yeah. The girl who looks
up to you more than anyone

209
00:11:16,957 --> 00:11:20,920
will inherit your Titan
and will die at age 27.

210
00:11:21,757 --> 00:11:23,405
And that's if an artillery shell doesn't

211
00:11:23,489 --> 00:11:25,186
take her down first.

212
00:11:26,356 --> 00:11:28,287
Are you really okay with that?

213
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,072
Did you just say what I think you did?

214
00:11:32,156 --> 00:11:34,138
How dare you claim that
inheriting one of the Nine

215
00:11:34,222 --> 00:11:35,353
is less than an honor.

216
00:11:36,823 --> 00:11:38,405
If I choose to report this,

217
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,138
it'll be you and your family dropped out

218
00:11:40,222 --> 00:11:42,004
of an airship as Titans next.

219
00:11:42,088 --> 00:11:43,805
Wait. Please don't do that.

220
00:11:43,889 --> 00:11:46,138
I'm so sorry: Allow me
to correct myself.

221
00:11:46,222 --> 00:11:48,339
I, Warrior Candidate Falco Grice,

222
00:11:48,423 --> 00:11:50,339
wish to atone for my ancestor's crimes

223
00:11:50,423 --> 00:11:51,873
and for my wicked blood.

224
00:11:51,956 --> 00:11:54,072
Towards that end,
I pledge my life to Marley.

225
00:11:54,156 --> 00:11:55,405
And what are your thoughts on the honor

226
00:11:55,489 --> 00:11:58,138
of inheriting one of the Nine,
Warrior Candidate?

227
00:11:58,222 --> 00:12:01,205
Inheriting one of the Nine
makes you an Honorary Marleyan.

228
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:03,739
Nothing would make me prouder
than to be given such a chance

229
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,938
to display my loyalty to the motherland.

230
00:12:06,022 --> 00:12:08,486
Then you must want to inherit the Armor.

231
00:12:14,423 --> 00:12:17,339
I don't just want to inherit
the Armor. I have to.

232
00:12:17,423 --> 00:12:18,286
That's right.

233
00:12:19,688 --> 00:12:22,271
Surpass Gabi to protect her.

234
00:12:22,355 --> 00:12:25,053
Spare her from the dark future we face.

235
00:12:44,521 --> 00:12:48,705
Woohoo! We're finally back!

236
00:12:48,789 --> 00:12:51,838
I swear, the air tastes
different here in Liberio!

237
00:12:51,922 --> 00:12:53,437
Guess who's home!

238
00:12:53,521 --> 00:12:56,819
Hey. Please, I asked
you not to yell.

239
00:12:58,922 --> 00:13:00,371
Yeah, well I asked you not to

240
00:13:00,455 --> 00:13:02,452
drink so much, lightweight.

241
00:13:03,322 --> 00:13:04,838
I don't understand
who would give him wine

242
00:13:04,922 --> 00:13:06,437
in the first place.

243
00:13:06,521 --> 00:13:09,238
I thought he looked like
he could use a nightcap.

244
00:13:09,321 --> 00:13:10,637
Come on, Colt.

245
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:12,238
How could you spew Pieck's kindness

246
00:13:12,321 --> 00:13:14,437
all over the train like that?

247
00:13:14,521 --> 00:13:17,386
I suppose we should've
shut them up after all.

248
00:13:18,321 --> 00:13:20,838
Our comrades were
chanting your name all night.

249
00:13:20,922 --> 00:13:22,571
Colt put them up to it.

250
00:13:22,655 --> 00:13:26,505
No worries. You deserved
a healthy dose of praise.

251
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:28,705
What you did really was impressive.

252
00:13:28,789 --> 00:13:30,386
Thanks a lot, Pieck!

253
00:13:33,321 --> 00:13:35,705
Vice Chief Braun.

254
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:38,371
Is he thinking the same thing as me?

255
00:13:38,455 --> 00:13:41,486
Does he want Eldians
to be free from war, too?

256
00:13:43,389 --> 00:13:46,352
If so, can I trust him?

257
00:13:54,655 --> 00:13:57,637
All right. Take it easy,
enjoy your break!

258
00:13:57,721 --> 00:14:00,637
Not me! I'll get back
to training tomorrow!

259
00:14:00,721 --> 00:14:02,437
What, are you trying to
boost your grades?

260
00:14:02,521 --> 00:14:03,638
Ugh, will ya gimme a break?

261
00:14:03,722 --> 00:14:05,371
No! That's not
what this is about!

262
00:14:05,455 --> 00:14:07,637
Hey, you two.

263
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,819
Try not to push yourselves too hard.

264
00:14:21,255 --> 00:14:22,452
Hey, Dad.

265
00:14:27,189 --> 00:14:28,437
Ah, Zeke.

266
00:14:28,521 --> 00:14:30,838
Grandpa! Grandma!

267
00:14:30,922 --> 00:14:32,838
It's so good to see you.

268
00:14:32,922 --> 00:14:35,237
We're so very proud of
all your achievements.

269
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:37,638
I'm not done. Not yet.

270
00:14:37,722 --> 00:14:39,371
Colt! Falco!

271
00:14:39,455 --> 00:14:40,771
Colt! You look so pale!

272
00:14:40,855 --> 00:14:43,638
There they are! Mom! Dad!

273
00:14:43,722 --> 00:14:45,519
Gabi!

274
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:52,371
Reiner.
You must be exhausted.

275
00:14:52,455 --> 00:14:54,437
Let's get you home so you can rest.

276
00:14:54,521 --> 00:14:58,319
Hey, Mom. A little
rest sounds good.

277
00:15:00,455 --> 00:15:02,705
Uh. I'll meet you all in a bit.

278
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:04,905
Ugh. For crying out loud!

279
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:07,371
Don't you know how to stand anymore?

280
00:15:07,455 --> 00:15:09,638
Mr. Koslow. What's wrong
with these soldiers?

281
00:15:09,722 --> 00:15:12,638
Ugh. Stay outta
the way, you nosy brat.

282
00:15:12,722 --> 00:15:15,638
This is a sorry bunch of
Eldians with mental trauma.

283
00:15:15,722 --> 00:15:17,237
It happens to our guys, too?

284
00:15:17,321 --> 00:15:19,371
It's from all that time
digging on the front lines,

285
00:15:19,455 --> 00:15:21,237
surrounded by bombs and bullets.

286
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:23,838
In their heads, these guys
are still in the trenches.

287
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:26,919
Kaboom!

288
00:15:29,455 --> 00:15:31,638
Wow. Guess their killer
instincts kicked in.

289
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:35,153
Hey, it's all right.
You're not in danger.

290
00:15:36,389 --> 00:15:39,171
Your armband's on the wrong side.

291
00:15:39,255 --> 00:15:40,638
It's okay, sir.

292
00:15:40,722 --> 00:15:42,771
I'm sure that you'll get better.

293
00:15:42,855 --> 00:15:44,171
It's over now.

294
00:15:44,255 --> 00:15:45,838
You don't have to fight anymore.

295
00:15:45,922 --> 00:15:47,186
Kaboom!

296
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:50,638
The grenades landed
exactly where I'd aimed them

297
00:15:50,722 --> 00:15:52,571
and blew the train right off its tracks!

298
00:15:52,655 --> 00:15:54,505
I'd actually pulled it off!

299
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:56,305
But as I was running
back to the trenches,

300
00:15:56,389 --> 00:15:57,905
the enemy shot a machine gun at me,

301
00:15:57,989 --> 00:16:00,371
and just as I was about to eat lead, uh...

302
00:16:00,455 --> 00:16:02,237
Mr. Galliard jumped in
out of nowhere

303
00:16:02,321 --> 00:16:03,772
and protected me with his Jaw Titan!

304
00:16:03,856 --> 00:16:05,437
That's amazing, Gabi!

305
00:16:05,521 --> 00:16:07,437
It sounds like a whole
bunch of our soldiers

306
00:16:07,521 --> 00:16:09,638
owe their lives to your bravery!

307
00:16:09,722 --> 00:16:12,371
Our little girl has grown
into an Eldian hero!

308
00:16:12,455 --> 00:16:14,820
We couldn't be prouder of you, dear.

309
00:16:16,521 --> 00:16:17,371
Reiner.

310
00:16:17,455 --> 00:16:20,171
Do you think Gabi will
become a Warrior like you?

311
00:16:20,255 --> 00:16:22,905
Yeah. After what she
pulled off at Fort Slava,

312
00:16:22,989 --> 00:16:25,771
she's all-but guaranteed
to inherit my Armor.

313
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,571
That's wonderful to hear.

314
00:16:27,655 --> 00:16:30,571
To think that our family will be
blessed with two Warriors.

315
00:16:30,655 --> 00:16:32,371
It's such a rare honor.

316
00:16:32,455 --> 00:16:34,571
I just hope you'll find
a way to rid the world

317
00:16:34,655 --> 00:16:36,437
of those island devils.

318
00:16:36,521 --> 00:16:39,719
After that, our people will
be able to live good lives.

319
00:16:40,522 --> 00:16:43,305
Say, Reiner. Not to pry, but...

320
00:16:43,389 --> 00:16:45,772
I hear you barely escaped from
those devils with your life.

321
00:16:45,856 --> 00:16:48,171
Leave Reiner alone, Dad.

322
00:16:48,255 --> 00:16:50,838
His time on that island isn't
some light-hearted war story.

323
00:16:50,922 --> 00:16:52,571
Those devils put him through hell.

324
00:16:52,655 --> 00:16:54,771
So even if it wasn't classified,

325
00:16:54,855 --> 00:16:56,171
there's no way that it's something

326
00:16:56,255 --> 00:16:58,171
he would wanna talk about.

327
00:16:58,255 --> 00:17:02,237
You're right. Sorry,
nephew. Forgive me.

328
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:05,705
No. I can tell you some things.

329
00:17:05,789 --> 00:17:08,838
As you know,
I infiltrated their military.

330
00:17:08,922 --> 00:17:11,171
As expected, they acted like devils.

331
00:17:11,255 --> 00:17:13,771
Each of them was savage and cruel.

332
00:17:13,855 --> 00:17:18,171
During our induction, one devil
started eating a potato.

333
00:17:18,255 --> 00:17:20,171
When the instructor yelled
at her, she told him,

334
00:17:20,255 --> 00:17:24,838
without hesitation, that she
stole it 'cause it looked good.

335
00:17:24,922 --> 00:17:26,505
She knew she's crossed a line,

336
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:30,838
so she bribed the instructor
by offering him half the potato.

337
00:17:30,922 --> 00:17:32,838
However, the half she offered him

338
00:17:32,922 --> 00:17:35,772
was visibly smaller than her half.

339
00:17:35,856 --> 00:17:39,437
They don't even know what
compromise means there.

340
00:17:39,521 --> 00:17:42,571
Each of them was more
hopeless than the last.

341
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,437
There was one guy so stupid he'd forget

342
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,638
why he'd gone into the bathroom.

343
00:17:46,722 --> 00:17:49,838
An insincere jerk who only
ever thought about himself.

344
00:17:49,922 --> 00:17:53,371
A soft-hearted oaf who
only ever thought of others.

345
00:17:53,455 --> 00:17:55,571
A brave but single-minded fool,

346
00:17:55,655 --> 00:17:58,705
and a bunch of chumps
who followed his lead.

347
00:17:58,789 --> 00:18:01,305
Alongside all those different people,

348
00:18:01,389 --> 00:18:03,419
stood me and my comrades.

349
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:07,820
The time that we spent
there was truly hell.

350
00:18:13,856 --> 00:18:17,638
I said way too much. Forget it.

351
00:18:17,722 --> 00:18:20,171
What do you mean by "different people"?

352
00:18:20,255 --> 00:18:22,305
They're bad people, right?

353
00:18:22,389 --> 00:18:25,237
Of course they are,
Gabi. They're all devils.

354
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:27,705
And they're holding this
whole world by the throat.

355
00:18:27,789 --> 00:18:30,838
They could unleash their army
of huge Titans at any moment

356
00:18:30,922 --> 00:18:32,905
and crush us all beneath their feet.

357
00:18:32,989 --> 00:18:35,171
They aren't anything like you and me.

358
00:18:35,255 --> 00:18:38,186
We're good Eldians.
And we have to stop them.

359
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:42,438
We have to punish the wicked
Eldians who abandoned us.

360
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:45,371
Who fled and built themselves a paradise

361
00:18:45,455 --> 00:18:48,086
on top of a mountain of corpses.

362
00:18:55,789 --> 00:18:59,237
Everything okay, Gabi?
You seem upset.

363
00:18:59,321 --> 00:19:02,305
You do know that Aunt Karina's
worried about you, right?

364
00:19:02,389 --> 00:19:04,371
She says that you changed on the island.

365
00:19:04,455 --> 00:19:06,237
That her kid is gone.

366
00:19:06,321 --> 00:19:08,838
Well. I left as
a 12-year-old boy,

367
00:19:08,922 --> 00:19:13,305
and came back a grown man,
so she's not exactly wrong.

368
00:19:13,389 --> 00:19:15,505
It feels like
you're lying. So...

369
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:18,237
Lying? Why would I bother?

370
00:19:18,321 --> 00:19:20,237
Honestly, I have no idea.

371
00:19:20,321 --> 00:19:23,305
But I feel like Aunt
Karina's worked it out.

372
00:19:23,389 --> 00:19:25,237
I heard it was a soldier.

373
00:19:25,321 --> 00:19:26,620
That's awful.

374
00:19:28,189 --> 00:19:29,838
Hey, good morning.

375
00:19:29,922 --> 00:19:31,772
Looks like all of us are here now.

376
00:19:31,856 --> 00:19:33,505
This is a rare occasion.

377
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:36,638
Why are we all meeting
in your office, Zeke?

378
00:19:36,722 --> 00:19:38,237
And where's the brass?

379
00:19:38,321 --> 00:19:39,905
They're not here in this room.

380
00:19:39,988 --> 00:19:42,371
Can't we all just meet for some tea?

381
00:19:42,455 --> 00:19:43,686
Sure...

382
00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:48,838
Now then. The battle of
Fort Slava made it clear

383
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:51,438
that conventional weapons
are advancing fast.

384
00:19:51,522 --> 00:19:53,438
They'll soon be stronger than Titans.

385
00:19:53,522 --> 00:19:55,171
That's bad news on two fronts.

386
00:19:55,255 --> 00:19:58,572
We'll lose our tactical value
as Marley loses her strength.

387
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:01,237
This threatens the whole Eldian race.

388
00:20:01,321 --> 00:20:03,371
And there is but one solution.

389
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:05,638
Marley must seize the
Founding Titan's power

390
00:20:05,722 --> 00:20:08,438
as well as the resources of Paradis.

391
00:20:08,522 --> 00:20:10,638
Before that, the world
must be reminded of

392
00:20:10,722 --> 00:20:13,438
the terrible threat
that island poses to us all.

393
00:20:13,522 --> 00:20:16,186
And every good story needs a narrator.

394
00:20:17,189 --> 00:20:20,438
The Tybur family will provide one for us.

395
00:20:20,522 --> 00:20:23,438
They're the keepers of
the War Hammer, is that right?

396
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,438
Yeah, but the Tybur's
have never once used

397
00:20:25,522 --> 00:20:28,705
the War Hammer Titan
against an enemy state.

398
00:20:28,789 --> 00:20:29,638
They're known as the family that

399
00:20:29,722 --> 00:20:32,438
drove off King Fritz
in the Great Titan War.

400
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,772
They aren't hated like most Eldians.

401
00:20:34,856 --> 00:20:37,772
If we speak through the Tyburs,
the world will hear us out.

402
00:20:37,856 --> 00:20:40,638
Astute as ever, Pieck!
You're exactly right!

403
00:20:40,722 --> 00:20:43,571
But the Tyburs have been living lives

404
00:20:43,655 --> 00:20:45,238
of luxury and freedom.

405
00:20:45,322 --> 00:20:47,772
They've never fought for
their country or their people.

406
00:20:47,856 --> 00:20:49,838
Why should they get to play hero now?

407
00:20:49,921 --> 00:20:51,905
I know how you feel, but the Tyburs are

408
00:20:51,989 --> 00:20:54,572
just as concerned about Marley as we are.

409
00:20:54,656 --> 00:20:56,238
Maybe. But they're...

410
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:58,171
If it saves our motherland, Marley,

411
00:20:58,255 --> 00:20:59,838
that's enough for me.

412
00:20:59,921 --> 00:21:03,505
Our duty as Warriors
is to support the Tyburs,

413
00:21:03,589 --> 00:21:06,838
and to serve as scaffolding
as a new Marley is built.

414
00:21:06,921 --> 00:21:08,037
Well said.

415
00:21:08,121 --> 00:21:11,305
Very soon, a festival will
take place here in Liberio.

416
00:21:11,389 --> 00:21:12,438
You don't say.

417
00:21:12,522 --> 00:21:15,237
Foreign dignitaries
and VIPs will be invited

418
00:21:15,321 --> 00:21:17,852
to hear this announcement
from the Tyburs:

419
00:21:18,589 --> 00:21:22,837
We will conquer Paradis
Island within the next year.

420
00:21:22,921 --> 00:21:26,772
The fates of the Eldian people
and of Marley rest on this plan.

421
00:21:26,855 --> 00:21:28,638
We cannot let it fail.

422
00:21:28,722 --> 00:21:30,837
For the future of our motherland Marley,

423
00:21:30,921 --> 00:21:34,505
we must join our hearts and minds as one.

424
00:21:34,589 --> 00:21:35,772
All right, then.

425
00:21:35,855 --> 00:21:37,638
Galliard has a complaint or two,

426
00:21:37,722 --> 00:21:39,905
but he always follows orders in the end.

427
00:21:39,989 --> 00:21:43,305
If this is all they're saying
in private, I'm not concerned.

428
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:46,219
I just wish Zeke hadn't
thrown that comment in.

429
00:21:47,921 --> 00:21:50,419
"Not here in this room," huh.

430
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:06,553
Will I have to go
back... to that damn island?

431
00:23:40,037 --> 00:23:41,820
Honorary Marleyan.

432
00:23:41,904 --> 00:23:43,620
Esteemed Warrior.

433
00:23:43,704 --> 00:23:45,420
What he wanted to be.

434
00:23:45,504 --> 00:23:47,620
What he never could be.

435
00:23:47,704 --> 00:23:49,953
Did he choose the right path?

436
00:23:50,037 --> 00:23:51,887
Did he have a choice?

437
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:54,768
Next episode:
"The Door of Hope."
