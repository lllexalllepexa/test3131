<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}It doesn't really strike me as

19
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:04,146
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}but I can't say that it's

25
00:01:14,446 --> 00:01:16,706

any options back then!

31
00:01:25,296 --> 00:01:27,416
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}But now, Eren has Yelena
completely convinced

00:02:05,586 --> 00:02:07,796
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}I've been calling Eren

00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:46,546
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}We should focus on staying alive
