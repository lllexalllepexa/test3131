1
00:00:01,044 --> 00:00:03,560
I'm taking the Founder right now!

2
00:00:03,644 --> 00:00:05,408
Eren!

3
00:00:11,844 --> 00:00:14,293
Wait. Could that be him?

4
00:00:14,377 --> 00:00:16,575
Is that Ackermann?

5
00:00:20,978 --> 00:00:22,760
What the hell?

6
00:00:22,844 --> 00:00:24,875
Can't you see I'm a Titan?

7
00:00:26,778 --> 00:00:28,960
Are a bunch of humans

8
00:00:29,044 --> 00:00:30,560
really about to

9
00:00:30,644 --> 00:00:32,708
come and kill me?

10
00:00:34,778 --> 00:00:37,493
No. They're not humans.

11
00:00:37,577 --> 00:00:39,308
They're devils!

12
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:46,960
Behind us!
Fall back! Take cover!

13
00:00:47,044 --> 00:00:49,041
Shit! I can't shake 'em!

14
00:01:02,978 --> 00:01:05,308
Damn it. We took too long.

15
00:01:06,844 --> 00:01:08,694
The Cart Titan's here.

16
00:01:08,778 --> 00:01:10,360
Pieck!

17
00:01:10,444 --> 00:01:12,275
Made it just in time.

18
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:14,760
My heavy machine gun armament

19
00:01:14,844 --> 00:01:17,494
is a perfect counter to their ODM gear.

20
00:01:17,578 --> 00:01:20,208
It was worth the time
it took to equip it.

21
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:37,742
Eren!

22
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:55,241
It's him. The Beast Titan.

23
00:01:56,778 --> 00:01:58,241
It's Zeke!

24
00:02:06,978 --> 00:02:10,508
Eren Jaeger. I'll kill you!

25
00:02:18,043 --> 00:02:19,960
Kill all of them.

26
00:02:20,043 --> 00:02:21,809
Let none escape.

27
00:02:22,912 --> 00:02:25,709
Stay alive. That's an order.

28
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,771
What the...?

29
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,990
No way. Is that... Mr. Kruger?

30
00:05:17,074 --> 00:05:19,971
No. It's Eren Jaeger.

31
00:05:21,674 --> 00:05:22,838
Damn you!

32
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,790
Wait, Vice Chief Braun!

33
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:33,437
Hey, it's me!

34
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,990
Vice Chief!

35
00:05:37,074 --> 00:05:39,838
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

36
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,056
He's still alive.

37
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,990
But he's unconscious.

38
00:05:50,074 --> 00:05:51,523
His body should be healing itself

39
00:05:51,607 --> 00:05:53,470
with the Power of the Titans.

40
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:59,005
At least, as long as
he has the will to... live...

41
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,124
I can't take this anymore.

42
00:06:04,207 --> 00:06:06,204
Please just kill me.

43
00:06:12,207 --> 00:06:15,638
Sit tight, sir. I'll get help.

44
00:06:17,874 --> 00:06:19,056
You know, there're people out there

45
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:20,856
who aren't enemies.

46
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,189
Udo and Gabi.

47
00:06:22,273 --> 00:06:23,189
Zofia.

48
00:06:23,273 --> 00:06:25,137
All of us are on your side.

49
00:06:26,074 --> 00:06:28,738
Just hang in there. Okay?

50
00:06:31,674 --> 00:06:32,838
Incoming!

51
00:06:37,207 --> 00:06:38,590
That bastard's gonna pay!

52
00:06:38,674 --> 00:06:40,123
Wait! Get back!

53
00:06:40,207 --> 00:06:42,071
I'll kill him here and now!

54
00:06:45,008 --> 00:06:47,656
Good work. Continue to cover
the War Chief's six.

55
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,656
Right!

56
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,656
Just above us!

57
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,871
Bad angle!

58
00:06:57,273 --> 00:06:59,656
Thanks, Galliard!
You saved our butts.

59
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,456
'Preciate the help!

60
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,389
Nice one, Pock!

61
00:07:01,473 --> 00:07:03,590
That was close! Thanks!

62
00:07:03,674 --> 00:07:04,790
Stay on your toes.

63
00:07:04,874 --> 00:07:06,856
I ran into Ackermann a minute ago.

64
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,856
He's still hiding nearby.

65
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,256
This is bad.

66
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,656
Porco! The War Hammer!

67
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,704
Huh?

68
00:07:19,874 --> 00:07:23,189
You formed a crystal shell like Annie's.

69
00:07:23,273 --> 00:07:26,590
It's clearly much harder than my teeth.

70
00:07:26,674 --> 00:07:30,055
But I know that you've spent
the last of your strength.

71
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:31,790
If you had any left,

72
00:07:31,874 --> 00:07:33,790
you would've used the War Hammer's power

73
00:07:33,874 --> 00:07:36,123
to pierce my neck by now.

74
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:39,471
You don't have any moves left to play.

75
00:07:41,273 --> 00:07:43,805
Looks like I've outlasted you.

76
00:07:51,607 --> 00:07:54,790
Shit. After all that,

77
00:07:54,874 --> 00:07:57,871
the bastard still has more fight in him?

78
00:07:58,808 --> 00:08:02,055
But if we can take him down,
the Founder's ours.

79
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:04,256
What are you so worried about, Pock?

80
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,724
Huh?

81
00:08:05,808 --> 00:08:08,123
There isn't any need for us to rush this.

82
00:08:08,207 --> 00:08:09,656
We have control of the battlefield

83
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:12,256
and its surroundings.

84
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:15,523
All we need to do now is tighten our net.

85
00:08:15,607 --> 00:08:18,256
The enemy took to the
field wearing ODM gear.

86
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:22,055
So they have a limited supply
of fuel and ammunition.

87
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:26,537
In short, they're stranded in
enemy territory with no support.

88
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,189
And the incoming Marleyan reinforcements

89
00:08:29,273 --> 00:08:31,189
have already surrounded the zone,

90
00:08:31,273 --> 00:08:33,856
so there's no escape.

91
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:36,055
Paradis never stood
a chance against Marley

92
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:38,056
in a proper war, anyway.

93
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,856
They don't have enough
people or resources.

94
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:43,523
That's why it's so crucial
we take out the Founder!

95
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,590
Once they lose the power
to start the Rumbling,

96
00:08:45,674 --> 00:08:46,856
they'll be helpless.

97
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,256
It's the ace up their sleeve,
and it's right in front of us!

98
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,056
Which makes it that much more important

99
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:53,656
that we proceed with caution.

100
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,189
For the time being, at least,

101
00:08:55,273 --> 00:08:58,724
focus on protecting the
War Chief from Ackermann.

102
00:08:58,808 --> 00:09:03,137
Astute as ever, Pieck.
You're exactly right.

103
00:09:13,607 --> 00:09:15,989
I'm not here to fight you, Eren.

104
00:09:16,073 --> 00:09:18,738
I have another opponent.

105
00:09:26,808 --> 00:09:29,189
Let's have our rematch, Levi.

106
00:09:29,273 --> 00:09:32,656
Come on. Show yourself.

107
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,905
You're running out of time, right?

108
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,656
Okay. If there's anyone
who can deal with this mess,

109
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,790
it's War Chief Zeke.

110
00:09:46,874 --> 00:09:48,137
Grice?

111
00:09:49,207 --> 00:09:52,656
Commander Magath! Please
sir, listen! By the stage...

112
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,856
What are you doing?

113
00:09:53,939 --> 00:09:55,856
You haven't been injured, have you?

114
00:09:55,939 --> 00:09:57,856
No. I'm fine!

115
00:09:57,939 --> 00:09:59,790
Then you need to get
the hell out of here.

116
00:09:59,874 --> 00:10:02,856
Sir. Vice Chief Braun
is underground behind the stage.

117
00:10:02,939 --> 00:10:04,856
He's not moving:
It's like he's in a coma.

118
00:10:04,939 --> 00:10:06,256
What happened?

119
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:10,523
It's my fault. He saved my life.

120
00:10:10,607 --> 00:10:12,856
Who'd he save you from?

121
00:10:12,939 --> 00:10:16,671
It was Eren Jaeger.

122
00:10:24,808 --> 00:10:25,857
Hurry and dock!

123
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:29,056
We need to reinforce the
troops in Liberio quickly!

124
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:33,123
I'm told that they're taking
devastating losses there! Huh?

125
00:10:33,207 --> 00:10:35,590
Hey! Can't you see
the fleet around you?

126
00:10:35,674 --> 00:10:38,256
Get that fishing boat outta here!

127
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,671
Hey!

128
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:44,171
Huh?

129
00:11:04,273 --> 00:11:06,638
Our... ships...

130
00:11:10,073 --> 00:11:11,256
Snap out of it!

131
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,123
Get as far away from here as you can.

132
00:11:13,207 --> 00:11:14,790
But, Commander. What was...

133
00:11:14,873 --> 00:11:18,137
They took out our port.
And only one Titan can...

134
00:11:19,939 --> 00:11:22,190
It looks like they have the Colossal now.

135
00:11:22,274 --> 00:11:24,590
They didn't just kill Bertholdt.

136
00:11:24,674 --> 00:11:26,190
They took his Titan.

137
00:11:26,274 --> 00:11:28,923
Vicious bastards!

138
00:11:29,007 --> 00:11:30,524
It seems they didn't barge in here

139
00:11:30,608 --> 00:11:33,524
without a plan after all!

140
00:11:33,608 --> 00:11:36,190
Give us your worst, you damn devils.

141
00:11:36,274 --> 00:11:38,855
Your plans'll mean jack shit
if I take the Founder

142
00:11:38,939 --> 00:11:40,705
before you can act on them!

143
00:11:42,073 --> 00:11:44,590
Is that the other Ackermann?

144
00:11:44,674 --> 00:11:46,171
Doesn't matter!

145
00:11:50,807 --> 00:11:52,855
War Chief!
They're coming up on our right.

146
00:12:13,073 --> 00:12:14,638
- - Zeke!
- -Get down!

147
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:22,656
No way...

148
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:24,871
Pieck! We've got incoming!

149
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,190
What happened?

150
00:12:48,274 --> 00:12:49,524
Hey. Carlo!

151
00:12:49,608 --> 00:12:52,904
Come on, say something! Carlo!

152
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,656
You'll pay for that!

153
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,904
I think it's your turn to pay.

154
00:13:09,873 --> 00:13:11,737
Fire! Hurry!

155
00:13:16,274 --> 00:13:17,538
Pieck!

156
00:13:19,074 --> 00:13:20,638
My men!

157
00:13:35,207 --> 00:13:36,605
Pieck!

158
00:14:32,885 --> 00:14:37,182
Is this... the same view
that you had, Bertholdt?

159
00:14:38,217 --> 00:14:40,133
It must be.

160
00:14:40,217 --> 00:14:42,867
No, please. Don't kill her.

161
00:14:42,951 --> 00:14:45,015
Come on! Finish it!

162
00:14:48,017 --> 00:14:51,149
Don't shoot! Leave Pieck alone!

163
00:15:02,752 --> 00:15:04,534
The shot missed.

164
00:15:04,618 --> 00:15:05,933
What happened?

165
00:15:06,017 --> 00:15:07,867
Did the steam knock it off course?

166
00:15:07,951 --> 00:15:11,267
Or did I hesitate because of that kid?

167
00:15:11,351 --> 00:15:14,933
Pieck!

168
00:15:15,017 --> 00:15:17,668
The Cart Titan's still alive!

169
00:15:17,752 --> 00:15:19,534
Run away...

170
00:15:19,618 --> 00:15:21,267
I can't!

171
00:15:21,351 --> 00:15:23,948
Hurry, Falco.

172
00:15:26,017 --> 00:15:28,001
Keep Pieck covered!

173
00:15:28,085 --> 00:15:30,067
Eat lead, you damn devils!

174
00:15:30,151 --> 00:15:32,134
Hey, Braun! Give Grice a hand!

175
00:15:32,218 --> 00:15:33,915
Understood, sir!

176
00:15:35,752 --> 00:15:37,201
Fall back! Take cover!

177
00:15:37,285 --> 00:15:39,249
This way. Move!

178
00:15:41,752 --> 00:15:43,133
We're dropping like flies.

179
00:15:43,217 --> 00:15:45,133
First War Chief and now Pieck?

180
00:15:45,217 --> 00:15:46,933
Damn it. Damn it!

181
00:15:47,017 --> 00:15:47,734
Damn it!

182
00:15:47,817 --> 00:15:51,982
Damn you!

183
00:16:16,485 --> 00:16:20,315
He's fast. Much faster
than Ymir's Jaw Titan.

184
00:16:23,017 --> 00:16:27,682
So this is the power
of the Jaw. I see.

185
00:16:28,618 --> 00:16:32,534
It's horrible.
Her body can't heal fast enough.

186
00:16:32,618 --> 00:16:35,534
But she has the Power
of the Titans, so why?

187
00:16:35,618 --> 00:16:38,801
The Cart Titan isn't exactly
known for its toughness.

188
00:16:38,885 --> 00:16:41,001
It's not like the Armored Titan.

189
00:16:41,085 --> 00:16:43,134
Wait, where's Reiner?

190
00:16:43,218 --> 00:16:44,134
Is he somewhere close?

191
00:16:44,218 --> 00:16:46,267
You told the Commander
that Eren Jaeger got to him

192
00:16:46,351 --> 00:16:47,933
and knocked him out.

193
00:16:48,017 --> 00:16:50,334
But we can wake him up, right?

194
00:16:50,418 --> 00:16:51,733
I'm not so sure.

195
00:16:51,817 --> 00:16:54,334
He's still underground behind the plaza.

196
00:16:54,418 --> 00:16:57,933
But um... Listen.

197
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,134
I'm sorry, but I feel like maybe

198
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,334
we should let Reiner sit this one out.

199
00:17:01,418 --> 00:17:04,267
What are you saying?

200
00:17:04,351 --> 00:17:06,468
We need Reiner to fight.

201
00:17:06,552 --> 00:17:08,134
To avenge Udo and Zofia

202
00:17:08,218 --> 00:17:10,915
and all the other people
those devils killed.

203
00:17:18,418 --> 00:17:20,067
Hey. Get back here.

204
00:17:20,151 --> 00:17:21,534
Wait, don't go to the windows!

205
00:17:21,618 --> 00:17:23,848
You'll give our location away!

206
00:17:25,218 --> 00:17:26,215
Huh?

207
00:17:27,418 --> 00:17:29,282
Commander!

208
00:17:48,351 --> 00:17:51,334
Commander. I just
spotted the signal lights.

209
00:17:51,418 --> 00:17:52,334
That's a relief.

210
00:17:52,418 --> 00:17:54,067
At least we know that some of the mission

211
00:17:54,151 --> 00:17:55,733
went according to plan.

212
00:17:55,817 --> 00:17:58,134
Whelp. We're counting
on you, Onyankopon.

213
00:17:58,218 --> 00:18:00,534
I've got this, Hange.
Don't worry.

214
00:18:00,618 --> 00:18:03,468
Cross the Internment Zone
at low speed and altitude.

215
00:18:03,552 --> 00:18:06,934
Our troops'll be able to get up
to us with their ODM gear.

216
00:18:07,018 --> 00:18:08,867
We can really only fly through once,

217
00:18:08,951 --> 00:18:11,534
so any stragglers who
miss us are out of luck.

218
00:18:11,617 --> 00:18:14,733
Or in luck, if we get
shot out of the sky.

219
00:18:14,817 --> 00:18:17,534
You came up with one
hell of a reckless plan.

220
00:18:17,617 --> 00:18:20,934
What? You get possessed by
Erwin's ghost or something?

221
00:18:21,018 --> 00:18:22,933
To be honest, I wish I had.

222
00:18:23,017 --> 00:18:26,134
At a time like this,
I could use his strength.

223
00:18:26,218 --> 00:18:28,867
We're dancing on a
knife's edge yet again.

224
00:18:28,951 --> 00:18:31,933
This has to work, 'cause if
we lose Eren and the others,

225
00:18:32,017 --> 00:18:34,382
then we have no future in this world.

226
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:39,134
Jean. It's here.

227
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,134
Yeah. It's right on time.

228
00:18:41,218 --> 00:18:42,067
Don't tell me they're gonna

229
00:18:42,151 --> 00:18:44,334
try and escape on that thing?

230
00:18:44,418 --> 00:18:45,982
Not happening!

231
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,349
Shit!

232
00:19:22,817 --> 00:19:24,115
What's he...?

233
00:19:31,285 --> 00:19:32,882
H-Hey!

234
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:39,249
What are you doing?

235
00:19:43,151 --> 00:19:44,282
Stop.

236
00:19:48,352 --> 00:19:52,082
Stop it! Stop it!

237
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:07,982
Please! Stop!

238
00:20:23,352 --> 00:20:25,134
What just happened...?

239
00:20:25,218 --> 00:20:27,533
The War Hammer Titan got eaten.

240
00:20:27,617 --> 00:20:30,249
And the Jaw Titan is next.

241
00:20:38,151 --> 00:20:39,733
Then they've won.

242
00:20:39,817 --> 00:20:42,082
All our Warriors are finished.

243
00:20:50,617 --> 00:20:53,467
Wait. Not all.

244
00:20:53,551 --> 00:20:57,134
Reiner!

245
00:20:57,218 --> 00:21:01,334
Help us!

246
00:21:01,418 --> 00:21:02,134
Hey.

247
00:21:02,218 --> 00:21:04,334
You have to save Galliard!

248
00:21:04,418 --> 00:21:07,068
He's about to get eaten!

249
00:21:07,152 --> 00:21:12,134
You hear me? Help us!

250
00:21:12,218 --> 00:21:14,934
Reiner!

251
00:21:15,018 --> 00:21:16,682
Shut up.

252
00:21:18,085 --> 00:21:20,334
Just be quiet.

253
00:21:20,418 --> 00:21:21,934
Reiner!

254
00:21:22,018 --> 00:21:25,201
Reiner!

255
00:21:25,285 --> 00:21:27,334
Reiner!

256
00:21:27,418 --> 00:21:31,467
Please. Leave me alone.

257
00:21:31,551 --> 00:21:33,067
- -Help us!
- -Reiner!

258
00:21:33,151 --> 00:21:34,334
Cut it out, you brats!

259
00:21:34,417 --> 00:21:38,182
The enemy soldiers will
hear you! Stop shouting!

260
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:43,349
Why won't any of you...

261
00:22:01,285 --> 00:22:05,849
just let me... die in peace?

262
00:23:41,341 --> 00:23:44,990
Its strength spent,
the Armored Titan falls.

263
00:23:45,074 --> 00:23:47,724
Furious at the destruction
of her hometown,

264
00:23:47,808 --> 00:23:52,057
Gabi picks up a gun and
sets out to take revenge.

265
00:23:52,141 --> 00:23:54,971
Next episode:
"Assassin's Bullet."
