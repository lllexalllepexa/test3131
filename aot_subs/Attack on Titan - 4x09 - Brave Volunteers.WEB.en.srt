1
00:00:03,947 --> 00:00:05,863
I realize that you probably wouldn't know

2
00:00:05,946 --> 00:00:09,578
what to say to this,
but I want you to hear it.

3
00:00:11,547 --> 00:00:15,111
I guess I should start three years ago.

4
00:00:16,214 --> 00:00:18,812
Back when we still could've
changed something.

5
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,597
Captain!
No word from the advance party.

6
00:00:27,681 --> 00:00:29,397
It's been two hours.

7
00:00:29,481 --> 00:00:31,862
Hmm.
Then have teams two and three

8
00:00:31,946 --> 00:00:33,397
prepare to land as well.

9
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:34,663
Yes, sir!

10
00:00:34,747 --> 00:00:36,862
These damned island devils managed to

11
00:00:36,946 --> 00:00:39,463
defeat our Warrior unit.

12
00:00:39,547 --> 00:00:41,263
We need to find out
what they're doing now

13
00:00:41,347 --> 00:00:43,178
and relay it back to Marley.

14
00:00:47,347 --> 00:00:49,145
Grab onto something!

15
00:00:51,481 --> 00:00:54,545
It's... It's a devil!

16
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,463
Hello, ladies and gentlemen of Marley!

17
00:01:13,547 --> 00:01:16,263
Welcome to Paradis Island!

18
00:01:16,347 --> 00:01:18,330
Nice to meet'cha. I'm Hange!

19
00:01:18,414 --> 00:01:20,531
And it's an honor to welcome
guests who've sailed from

20
00:01:20,615 --> 00:01:22,597
oh-so-far across the sea to come here!

21
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:24,197
The trip must've left you exhausted,

22
00:01:24,281 --> 00:01:26,263
so why not join us for some tea?

23
00:01:26,347 --> 00:01:27,796
Oh! I almost forgot.

24
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,663
If you were curious about
this guest of ours,

25
00:01:29,747 --> 00:01:30,663
he arrived just before you

26
00:01:30,747 --> 00:01:32,796
and we're already
getting along splendidly!

27
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,378
Isn't that right? Tell them,
Nicolo!

28
00:01:37,547 --> 00:01:38,663
Please, Captain!

29
00:01:38,747 --> 00:01:42,463
Forget about me and gun these
devils down while you can!

30
00:01:42,547 --> 00:01:44,263
Huh? What are you saying?

31
00:01:44,347 --> 00:01:46,263
Captain!

32
00:01:46,347 --> 00:01:47,463
He's saying that he doesn't wanna be

33
00:01:47,547 --> 00:01:49,463
part of your shitty skit.

34
00:01:49,547 --> 00:01:50,796
Nicolo.

35
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,863
Know this, you wretched devils!

36
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:56,463
Marley doesn't negotiate
with filthy-bloods like you!

37
00:01:56,547 --> 00:01:58,263
And we're certainly not
gonna sit down with you

38
00:01:58,347 --> 00:02:00,263
and drink the pig piss you call tea!

39
00:02:00,347 --> 00:02:03,463
Huh?! Aw. Ya sure about that?

40
00:02:03,547 --> 00:02:05,263
Maybe you should be more polite.

41
00:02:05,347 --> 00:02:08,712
Unless you wanna piss off
the Titan looming behind you.

42
00:02:13,014 --> 00:02:15,731
Marley will never bend
to the power of devils!

43
00:02:15,814 --> 00:02:17,944
This is all she has to say to you!

44
00:02:24,746 --> 00:02:25,778
Huh?

45
00:02:31,746 --> 00:02:32,863
Put your hands up, Yelena!

46
00:02:32,947 --> 00:02:34,512
Lay down your weapons.

47
00:02:35,481 --> 00:02:36,463
What are you...?

48
00:02:36,547 --> 00:02:38,663
Do as she says.

49
00:02:38,746 --> 00:02:42,663
Hange. I'd like to
accept your invitation.

50
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,278
Let's have some tea.

51
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,877
How I've longed to meet you, Eren.

52
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,822
That big lady shot and killed her captain

53
00:04:30,906 --> 00:04:33,357
without a second thought.

54
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:35,357
What do you think she's hoping to do?

55
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,090
Can't say, but even if she's on our side,

56
00:04:38,174 --> 00:04:39,822
we obviously can't trust her.

57
00:04:39,906 --> 00:04:41,557
No napping, Sasha.

58
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:43,823
Yeah, but this is still
an incredible chance

59
00:04:43,907 --> 00:04:45,623
for us to gather information.

60
00:04:45,707 --> 00:04:47,623
We're really lucky we found them.

61
00:04:47,707 --> 00:04:50,037
You're right. We've been lucky.

62
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,623
We managed to intercept
that ship by pure chance.

63
00:04:54,707 --> 00:04:58,623
If Marley comes to this island
in force, we're finished.

64
00:04:58,707 --> 00:05:00,472
We've gotta do something.

65
00:05:01,575 --> 00:05:05,023
Ohh? Ohh!

66
00:05:05,107 --> 00:05:06,557
Oh, I see now!

67
00:05:06,641 --> 00:05:09,423
So that's why your guns
can shoot so many bullets!

68
00:05:09,507 --> 00:05:12,438
Back in Marley, those weapons
are standard-issue.

69
00:05:13,575 --> 00:05:16,756
The Marleyan army is
comprised of 50 divisions,

70
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,823
each made up of 20,000 troops.

71
00:05:18,907 --> 00:05:21,823
That comes out to a million
soldiers in total.

72
00:05:21,907 --> 00:05:23,557
Then there's the Marleyan navy.

73
00:05:23,641 --> 00:05:27,557
It's divided into three fleets,
with 21 battleships each.

74
00:05:27,641 --> 00:05:30,357
Marley's been developing
new weapons, too.

75
00:05:30,441 --> 00:05:33,357
They're making strides in
the field of aerial warfare.

76
00:05:33,441 --> 00:05:34,357
Aerial?

77
00:05:34,441 --> 00:05:38,756
Tch. Keep it together or
they'll think we're weak.

78
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:39,956
I know that!

79
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,823
In other words,
they're making flying ships,

80
00:05:42,907 --> 00:05:45,491
which can circumvent walls
by attacking from the sky.

81
00:05:45,575 --> 00:05:46,691
Huh?! They'll attack
from the sky?!

82
00:05:46,774 --> 00:05:48,756
Hange.

83
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,557
If Marley truly has the
kind of military capabilities

84
00:05:51,641 --> 00:05:52,823
you just described to us,

85
00:05:52,907 --> 00:05:55,823
why haven't they sent an
invasion force in the past year?

86
00:05:55,907 --> 00:05:57,090
Tell me.

87
00:05:57,174 --> 00:06:00,357
There are two primary reasons.

88
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:02,956
The first is the Pure Titans
Marley released here.

89
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,357
They pose a serious threat
to a landing force,

90
00:06:05,441 --> 00:06:09,023
even if that force is armed
with the latest weaponry.

91
00:06:09,107 --> 00:06:11,557
They were originally taken
here to keep you Eldians

92
00:06:11,641 --> 00:06:14,956
confined within your walls,
but in more recent times,

93
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:18,023
they've served as Eldia's
first line of defense.

94
00:06:18,107 --> 00:06:21,423
You don't say.
Well, isn't that funny?

95
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:23,623
But it'll be morning shortly,

96
00:06:23,706 --> 00:06:26,357
and day is when Titans become active.

97
00:06:26,441 --> 00:06:28,023
Which tells me that if we're still here,

98
00:06:28,107 --> 00:06:31,023
sipping tea in the wilderness
beyond the walls,

99
00:06:31,107 --> 00:06:32,823
you must have killed all the Pure Titans

100
00:06:32,907 --> 00:06:34,738
that were roaming around.

101
00:06:36,507 --> 00:06:38,623
Is my assessment correct?

102
00:06:38,706 --> 00:06:40,423
And what if it is?

103
00:06:40,507 --> 00:06:42,771
You gonna take that intel back to Marley?

104
00:06:44,641 --> 00:06:46,823
Never. It's amazing.

105
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,357
I am in awe.

106
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:51,491
So what's the second reason?

107
00:06:51,575 --> 00:06:52,756
Marley is occupied.

108
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,756
It's at war with an alliance
of several nations.

109
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,957
It can't be bothered to
deal with Paradis now.

110
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:02,090
You defeated the Warrior unit:
The pride of Marley.

111
00:07:02,174 --> 00:07:03,890
And in doing so, you stripped Marley of

112
00:07:03,974 --> 00:07:08,756
two of its best weapons:
The Colossal and Female Titans.

113
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,023
Marley is a nation with many enemies.

114
00:07:11,107 --> 00:07:13,823
Once they saw that you'd
left it in a weakened state,

115
00:07:13,907 --> 00:07:16,957
they quickly joined
as one and declared war.

116
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:19,690
I'm guessing that your group
infiltrated the Marleyan Army

117
00:07:19,774 --> 00:07:21,823
because you have some
sort of grudge against it.

118
00:07:21,907 --> 00:07:23,956
Are you undercover agents
from some of the nations

119
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,771
that Marley's conquered?

120
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,557
Oh? So I'm right!

121
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,423
If you're willing to
go up against Marley,

122
00:07:30,507 --> 00:07:33,804
then you must be working with
some seriously powerful backers.

123
00:07:35,107 --> 00:07:35,956
Sorry to disappoint,

124
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,622
but we're not agents
or anything of the sort.

125
00:07:39,706 --> 00:07:41,622
We were utterly powerless.

126
00:07:41,706 --> 00:07:46,423
Marley took our homes and
conscripted us into its army.

127
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,956
The hope that we could
eventually strike back

128
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,622
faded more every day.

129
00:07:50,706 --> 00:07:53,937
That is, until we met him.

130
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:57,957
People feared that Titan the world over.

131
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,491
They called him a devil.

132
00:08:00,575 --> 00:08:04,423
But to me, he looked like
something else entirely.

133
00:08:04,507 --> 00:08:05,756
A god.

134
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,671
One that gave hope to the powerless.

135
00:08:12,574 --> 00:08:14,357
Our mutiny was carried out

136
00:08:14,441 --> 00:08:16,823
at the express command of Zeke Jaeger.

137
00:08:16,907 --> 00:08:19,957
We're the Anti-Marleyan Volunteers.

138
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,838
And our goal is to
free the Eldian people.

139
00:08:25,574 --> 00:08:28,823
So, that concludes
Zeke Jaeger's requests.

140
00:08:28,907 --> 00:08:31,090
He claims that he can
save the Eldian people,

141
00:08:31,174 --> 00:08:32,690
who's existence is currently under th...

142
00:08:32,774 --> 00:08:33,556
Absurd!

143
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,823
We shouldn't even be listening to this!

144
00:08:35,907 --> 00:08:37,756
We're talking about the Beast Titan here!

145
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,556
He turned the people
of Ragako into Titans

146
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,623
and spread terror within the walls!

147
00:08:41,707 --> 00:08:44,023
He hunted the Scouts to near-extinction!

148
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:47,023
Now he has the gall to
come to us with requests?

149
00:08:47,107 --> 00:08:49,023
Zeke Jaeger's one and only goal is to

150
00:08:49,107 --> 00:08:51,756
steal the Founding Titan
from this island.

151
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,423
He failed to by force,
so now he's trying to

152
00:08:54,507 --> 00:08:56,823
obtain it through diplomatic means.

153
00:08:56,907 --> 00:08:59,357
Yes, he should know
that we'll assume that.

154
00:08:59,441 --> 00:09:03,823
Regardless, I would still like
to hear what else he has to say.

155
00:09:03,907 --> 00:09:06,357
Zeke Jaeger claims to
have an actionable plan

156
00:09:06,441 --> 00:09:09,023
that can solve all our
people's problems at once.

157
00:09:09,107 --> 00:09:12,023
And to carry this plan out,
we would need two key assets:

158
00:09:12,107 --> 00:09:15,690
The Founding Titan, and a Titan
possessing royal blood.

159
00:09:15,774 --> 00:09:18,556
He says that with both,
the world can be saved.

160
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,823
However, he will only reveal
the details of his plan

161
00:09:21,907 --> 00:09:24,623
after his conditions have been met.

162
00:09:24,707 --> 00:09:25,556
He's full of shit!

163
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:28,623
What kind of feckless idiots
does he take us for?

164
00:09:28,707 --> 00:09:29,357
Eren?

165
00:09:29,441 --> 00:09:32,957
Zeke is telling
the truth. I remember.

166
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,090
The Founder's power has always been

167
00:09:35,174 --> 00:09:38,357
completely impossible for me to use.

168
00:09:38,441 --> 00:09:39,756
The only exception was when I touched

169
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,823
a Titan with royal blood.

170
00:09:42,907 --> 00:09:45,423
I recognize that Titan from a picture.

171
00:09:45,506 --> 00:09:49,090
It had to be my dad's
first wife. Dina Fritz.

172
00:09:49,174 --> 00:09:50,823
Zeke is Dina's son.

173
00:09:50,907 --> 00:09:52,823
He must have figured it out, too.

174
00:09:52,907 --> 00:09:56,357
How to get around the
king's vow renouncing war.

175
00:09:56,441 --> 00:09:57,690
How to activate the only hope

176
00:09:57,774 --> 00:10:00,490
that still remains to us Eldians.

177
00:10:00,574 --> 00:10:02,623
He knows how to wake
the millions of Titans

178
00:10:02,707 --> 00:10:04,423
sleeping in the walls.

179
00:10:04,506 --> 00:10:07,757
How to start The Rumbling,
and crush the world.

180
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:13,357
Hey. Why did you keep
quiet about this for so long?

181
00:10:13,441 --> 00:10:16,423
'Cause I was concerned
for Historia's safety.

182
00:10:16,506 --> 00:10:19,023
At the time, I wasn't sure,
and I couldn't let her

183
00:10:19,107 --> 00:10:22,623
get turned into a Titan
based on some hunch of mine.

184
00:10:22,707 --> 00:10:25,490
It wasn't a well-thought-out
decision, I see that.

185
00:10:25,574 --> 00:10:27,423
We'll talk about it later.

186
00:10:27,506 --> 00:10:31,023
However, if everything
that you're saying is true,

187
00:10:31,107 --> 00:10:33,423
then Zeke's secret plan holds up.

188
00:10:33,506 --> 00:10:35,757
You trust them? Have you
lost your mind, Hange?

189
00:10:35,841 --> 00:10:37,757
The fact is, we can't risk letting these

190
00:10:37,841 --> 00:10:40,023
Marleyan soldiers roam the island freely.

191
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:42,756
If we were smart, we'd hang them!

192
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,357
No. That's not an option.

193
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,957
If we want to protect Paradis
from Marley's survey ships,

194
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,957
we need the volunteer's help.

195
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,757
They have something
called a "radio."

196
00:10:54,841 --> 00:10:58,023
This is Survey Ship
One. Requesting immediate aid.

197
00:10:58,107 --> 00:11:01,423
This is Survey Ship One!
Please respond!

198
00:11:01,507 --> 00:11:03,423
We read you.
What's your situation?

199
00:11:03,507 --> 00:11:06,823
Thank goodness!
Our ship ran aground!

200
00:11:06,907 --> 00:11:09,357
We've been waiting so long for help.

201
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,623
We're
coming! In the cove, huh?

202
00:11:12,707 --> 00:11:14,623
Our numbers? Don't worry!

203
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,938
We're sending two survey ships your way.

204
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,623
Hey! You all right?

205
00:11:20,707 --> 00:11:22,671
We're coming to pick you up!

206
00:11:25,574 --> 00:11:27,823
It's the Colossal Titan!

207
00:11:27,907 --> 00:11:29,005
How?!

208
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,823
Hey! It's the enemy!

209
00:11:31,907 --> 00:11:33,357
Hurry! Jump off!

210
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,556
Swim for the coast!

211
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,971
Abandon ship!

212
00:11:41,107 --> 00:11:44,091
Welcome to our defiled island
of filth-blooded devils.

213
00:11:44,175 --> 00:11:45,957
You're gonna love it here.

214
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,957
Long as you like drinking pig piss.

215
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,757
Feel free to turn us down,

216
00:11:50,841 --> 00:11:52,823
but if you don't wanna come ashore,

217
00:11:52,907 --> 00:11:54,805
you'll need to swim back home.

218
00:11:56,374 --> 00:11:58,957
It was fun back then.

219
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,023
We knew that as Eldians,

220
00:12:01,107 --> 00:12:04,023
we were feared and hated
by the rest of the world.

221
00:12:04,107 --> 00:12:06,423
By people on the other side of the sea

222
00:12:06,507 --> 00:12:08,838
whose faces we had never even seen.

223
00:12:09,707 --> 00:12:12,623
But not everyone across
the sea was an enemy.

224
00:12:12,707 --> 00:12:15,091
That fact gave us comfort.

225
00:12:15,175 --> 00:12:18,623
And we finally got to learn
about the outside world

226
00:12:18,707 --> 00:12:21,404
in all its complexities and mysteries.

227
00:12:22,774 --> 00:12:24,556
Oh, by the way.

228
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:27,404
Why is your skin so dark, Onyonkopon?

229
00:12:28,507 --> 00:12:31,823
Because our creator thought that
things would be more interesting

230
00:12:31,907 --> 00:12:35,623
if the world were occupied
by many kinds of people.

231
00:12:35,707 --> 00:12:38,757
I'd say that applies to you
Subjects of Ymir as well.

232
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,023
We exist because we were wanted.

233
00:12:42,107 --> 00:12:44,623
Wait, we were created? By who?

234
00:12:44,707 --> 00:12:47,957
By the one who gave power
to your Founder Ymir.

235
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,838
It was God.

236
00:12:50,907 --> 00:12:53,091
Well, that's what some people believe.

237
00:12:53,175 --> 00:12:55,504
We're all free to think
as we like, right?

238
00:13:01,507 --> 00:13:03,757
What the hell is this food?

239
00:13:03,841 --> 00:13:05,690
Is it even edible?

240
00:13:05,774 --> 00:13:06,823
Smells pretty fishy.

241
00:13:06,907 --> 00:13:08,890
Have you never had seafood before?

242
00:13:08,974 --> 00:13:11,557
Nicolo's a master when it
comes to Marleyan cuisine.

243
00:13:11,641 --> 00:13:14,490
Dumb jerks. If you don't like
how it looks, then don't eat it.

244
00:13:14,574 --> 00:13:16,705
Like I care what Eldians think...

245
00:13:22,041 --> 00:13:23,023
It's so good!

246
00:13:23,107 --> 00:13:24,504
Slow down!

247
00:13:25,707 --> 00:13:26,823
No fair, Sasha!

248
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:28,023
You're a genius.

249
00:13:28,107 --> 00:13:31,071
This is the best food I've ever eaten!

250
00:13:31,841 --> 00:13:34,690
Hey. Stop eating like
some kind of pig!

251
00:13:34,774 --> 00:13:37,571
I've never tasted anything like this!

252
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,404
There's plenty, so take your time.

253
00:13:48,107 --> 00:13:50,757
We should be finished
building the port soon.

254
00:13:50,841 --> 00:13:52,423
Progress has been fast

255
00:13:52,507 --> 00:13:55,423
since those Marleyan engineers
decided to help out.

256
00:13:55,507 --> 00:13:57,504
I'm kind of surprised they agreed to.

257
00:13:58,641 --> 00:13:59,757
It took time.

258
00:13:59,841 --> 00:14:03,623
At first, we were too suspicious
to cooperate at anything.

259
00:14:03,707 --> 00:14:05,623
But as we gradually set aside the labels

260
00:14:05,707 --> 00:14:07,023
we have for one another,

261
00:14:07,107 --> 00:14:10,623
and work to see each other as people,

262
00:14:10,707 --> 00:14:12,705
we can reach an understanding.

263
00:14:14,374 --> 00:14:17,823
Armin. Have you seen any
of Bertholdt's memories?

264
00:14:17,907 --> 00:14:22,891
Uh... yeah, but I didn't notice
anything that seemed helpful.

265
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,823
We're short on time.

266
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:27,891
Zeke has less than three years to live.

267
00:14:27,975 --> 00:14:30,490
Yeah, but about that.

268
00:14:30,574 --> 00:14:31,957
Do you really think it's okay for us

269
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,891
to just go along with Yelena's plan?

270
00:14:34,975 --> 00:14:36,690
What's the problem?

271
00:14:36,774 --> 00:14:38,423
I just wonder if we really have to

272
00:14:38,507 --> 00:14:40,023
threaten the world with the Rumbling

273
00:14:40,107 --> 00:14:42,423
to protect the Eldian people.

274
00:14:42,507 --> 00:14:44,557
We'd be forcing everyone
to live in fear of us.

275
00:14:44,641 --> 00:14:47,371
Acting like the devils they think we are.

276
00:14:48,107 --> 00:14:51,356
Before it comes to that,
why don't we just talk to them?

277
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,957
If we fix the world's
misconceptions about us,

278
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,623
threats won't be needed.

279
00:14:55,707 --> 00:14:59,423
Come again? What
misconceptions do they have?

280
00:14:59,507 --> 00:15:01,823
You know. How they think
we're scary monsters.

281
00:15:01,907 --> 00:15:03,957
They think that because we can transform

282
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:06,023
into man-eating Titans.

283
00:15:06,107 --> 00:15:08,271
That's no "misconception."

284
00:15:09,307 --> 00:15:12,423
But still. There are
some Marleyans who like us.

285
00:15:12,507 --> 00:15:13,957
How many?

286
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,356
Most of the Marleyans we caught
are still glaring at us

287
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,423
from their prison cells.

288
00:15:18,507 --> 00:15:20,957
That's true for now,
but given enough time.

289
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:24,638
Yeah. We just need time.

290
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:28,690
That's right, and to
buy ourselves that time,

291
00:15:28,774 --> 00:15:31,705
we need to show the world our strength.

292
00:15:37,507 --> 00:15:39,356
I still don't know

293
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,238
that we made the right choice back then.

294
00:15:44,174 --> 00:15:46,891
I can't help but wonder if there was

295
00:15:46,975 --> 00:15:51,271
some other path we could've
taken, if we'd just seen it.

296
00:15:52,507 --> 00:15:54,023
I used to think

297
00:15:54,107 --> 00:15:56,823
that I understood Eren
better than anyone.

298
00:15:56,907 --> 00:15:58,757
Even Mikasa.

299
00:15:58,841 --> 00:16:02,438
But... I don't know anymore.

300
00:16:16,907 --> 00:16:19,423
Hey! Aren't you a Marleyan?

301
00:16:19,507 --> 00:16:21,090
What the hell are you doing?

302
00:16:21,174 --> 00:16:24,090
This graveyard is full of
people your kind killed!

303
00:16:24,174 --> 00:16:25,023
You have no right...

304
00:16:25,106 --> 00:16:26,023
Hey, stop!

305
00:16:26,106 --> 00:16:28,271
Let us take care of this guy!

306
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,823
I'm sorry, but please.

307
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:34,557
Marleyans can go to hell.

308
00:16:34,641 --> 00:16:35,623
Hey, Nicolo!

309
00:16:35,707 --> 00:16:37,557
You okay?

310
00:16:37,641 --> 00:16:40,304
No. Why, damn it?

311
00:16:41,841 --> 00:16:44,271
Is it true that Sasha was killed?

312
00:16:45,507 --> 00:16:48,490
So it is. Then why?

313
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,838
What the hell were you guys doing?

314
00:16:55,441 --> 00:16:58,757
Shot by a kid who snuck onto the airship?

315
00:16:58,841 --> 00:17:02,471
It's too ridiculous to be true.

316
00:17:03,641 --> 00:17:08,357
It wasn't an ordinary kid.
The girl had been trained.

317
00:17:08,441 --> 00:17:10,557
Sounds like a Warrior candidate.

318
00:17:10,641 --> 00:17:13,605
Should've kept my
guard up. I'm sorry.

319
00:17:14,641 --> 00:17:17,423
Why apologize to me?

320
00:17:17,507 --> 00:17:19,838
All I did was cook her a meal or two.

321
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:23,356
Thank you.

322
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,671
Thank you for every tasty meal
you made for her, Nicolo.

323
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,905
How are you taking it, Conny?

324
00:17:32,975 --> 00:17:36,371
Sasha and I were like twins.

325
00:17:37,841 --> 00:17:40,838
So it feels like half of me is just gone.

326
00:17:43,707 --> 00:17:45,557
It's her family.

327
00:17:45,641 --> 00:17:48,772
Y'all were friends
with my daughter, Sasha?

328
00:17:56,707 --> 00:17:58,757
Uh. Pardon.

329
00:17:58,841 --> 00:18:00,023
I'm just a captive Marleyan,

330
00:18:00,107 --> 00:18:03,438
but I have permission to work as a chef.

331
00:18:04,841 --> 00:18:06,757
Your daughter loved my cooking

332
00:18:06,841 --> 00:18:09,757
more than anyone else ever will, I think.

333
00:18:09,841 --> 00:18:13,757
So um, if you ever want to,

334
00:18:13,841 --> 00:18:16,471
please come and let me
cook you something.

335
00:18:21,641 --> 00:18:23,557
This would be on the house, right?

336
00:18:23,641 --> 00:18:25,705
Yeah.

337
00:18:33,507 --> 00:18:36,423
How interesting.
They're calling it a victory?

338
00:18:36,507 --> 00:18:39,557
Ignorance is scary,
but delusion's even worse.

339
00:18:39,641 --> 00:18:42,623
I'm going to kill you and
ship your corpse back to Marley,

340
00:18:42,707 --> 00:18:45,357
with a note about your little plot.

341
00:18:45,441 --> 00:18:47,956
Should spell the end
for your grandparents.

342
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,423
That said, if this secret plan
of yours isn't bullshit,

343
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:54,423
I can wait and chop you up
once it's finished.

344
00:18:54,507 --> 00:18:56,956
I don't care much either way.

345
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:00,357
Well, I appreciate your
willingness to accommodate.

346
00:19:00,441 --> 00:19:03,956
But hey. I do get to
meet Eren soon, don't I?

347
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,956
There's no need to rush.

348
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,891
We've prepared a nice little
place for you to stay here.

349
00:19:08,974 --> 00:19:12,238
A beautiful hotel that you can relax at.

350
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:19,357
So, could I ask you to stop glaring?

351
00:19:19,441 --> 00:19:21,423
This is all the Titan
transformation serum

352
00:19:21,507 --> 00:19:23,956
we were able to steal from Marley.

353
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,090
Sorry, but it's hard to reproduce.

354
00:19:27,174 --> 00:19:31,423
It's fine. For our
purposes, this should be plenty.

355
00:19:31,507 --> 00:19:33,423
I just wish that we were in a position

356
00:19:33,507 --> 00:19:35,490
to return your kindness.

357
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:37,423
We owe you so much already.

358
00:19:37,507 --> 00:19:41,023
You turned our ignorance into
hope and got nothing in return.

359
00:19:41,107 --> 00:19:43,557
For us to doubt the people who saved us,

360
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:46,423
we truly are no better than devils.

361
00:19:46,507 --> 00:19:49,423
It is my opinion that
we've proven ourselves

362
00:19:49,507 --> 00:19:52,623
to be your loyal friends
over these past three years.

363
00:19:52,707 --> 00:19:54,623
This is a shame.

364
00:19:54,707 --> 00:19:56,890
The weapons that we offered you as gifts

365
00:19:56,974 --> 00:20:00,623
were intended to bring freedom
to the Eldian people.

366
00:20:00,707 --> 00:20:03,357
I know that this is a selfish request,

367
00:20:03,441 --> 00:20:06,557
but would you please overlook
our weakness for a time?

368
00:20:06,641 --> 00:20:10,823
We're going to great lengths
to keep Zeke on a tight leash.

369
00:20:10,906 --> 00:20:13,890
It's fine, Commander.
I understand.

370
00:20:13,974 --> 00:20:15,023
The day will soon come when we

371
00:20:15,107 --> 00:20:17,438
sit at the same table once again.

372
00:20:19,441 --> 00:20:21,956
This is my hotel?

373
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,757
What better lodging could there be?

374
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,823
It's a giant forest.

375
00:20:26,906 --> 00:20:29,956
Difficult to move through
and devoid of boulders.

376
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,757
Looks like a fun spot
for using ODM gear, too.

377
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,490
Hey. Quick question.

378
00:20:35,574 --> 00:20:36,557
This natural wonder.

379
00:20:36,641 --> 00:20:39,757
Would you mind letting me
show it to Gabi and Falco?

380
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:45,772
Tch. Whether they get to see the
sights or not depends on you.

381
00:20:53,907 --> 00:20:57,956
I'll kill you, Eren Jaeger.

382
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,623
Eren was ready to do it alone.

383
00:21:00,707 --> 00:21:03,823
Whether we helped him or abandoned him.

384
00:21:03,907 --> 00:21:06,638
The outcome would've
been awful either way.

385
00:21:07,575 --> 00:21:11,557
But now, we've killed
a huge number of people.

386
00:21:11,641 --> 00:21:15,423
Sailors. Soldiers. Civilians.

387
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:20,090
The devastation we spread
was indiscriminate.

388
00:21:20,174 --> 00:21:23,822
Still, if we had left that port intact,

389
00:21:23,906 --> 00:21:26,023
then Marley would've launched
an immediate counterattack

390
00:21:26,107 --> 00:21:28,491
against our island.

391
00:21:28,575 --> 00:21:30,822
We've abandoned all hope for peace,

392
00:21:30,906 --> 00:21:34,423
but we didn't have a choice.

393
00:21:34,507 --> 00:21:37,305
Any more than the three of you did.

394
00:21:38,707 --> 00:21:41,890
Right, Annie?

395
00:21:41,974 --> 00:21:44,771
Say something. Please.

396
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,956
Kill or be killed.

397
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,738
Fight for your life.

398
00:22:00,507 --> 00:22:03,557
The only way to live is to fight.

399
00:22:03,641 --> 00:22:07,004
So fight. Just fight.

400
00:23:40,632 --> 00:23:43,414
Without any allies on the outside,

401
00:23:43,498 --> 00:23:46,881
they must kill their
enemies in order to live.

402
00:23:46,965 --> 00:23:49,614
But is that the right choice to make?

403
00:23:49,697 --> 00:23:52,348
There isn't a soul who knows.

404
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:54,995
