1
00:00:04,382 --> 00:00:05,765
Gabi? Gabi!

2
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:06,765
What's wrong?

3
00:00:06,849 --> 00:00:08,431
Hey! Get a hold of yourself!

4
00:00:08,515 --> 00:00:10,231
Something wrong? What happened?

5
00:00:10,315 --> 00:00:12,431
I don't know. It's like she's
having some kind of seizure.

6
00:00:12,515 --> 00:00:14,479
Hey! You okay, missy?

7
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:26,112
Gabi! That's enough!

8
00:00:32,248 --> 00:00:34,431
What's the point of
running away like this?

9
00:00:34,515 --> 00:00:36,765
If we'd stayed in that cell
they would've killed us!

10
00:00:36,849 --> 00:00:37,565
I don't think so.

11
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:39,431
That guard was worried about you!

12
00:00:39,515 --> 00:00:41,631
You think we can trust those devils?

13
00:00:41,715 --> 00:00:44,231
We can't even trust Zeke anymore!

14
00:00:44,315 --> 00:00:46,579
Or anybody else!

15
00:00:57,783 --> 00:01:00,179
What? Bad dreams?

16
00:01:01,715 --> 00:01:05,231
How I wish all of this had been a dream.

17
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:08,231
I heard Gabi and Falco calling to me.

18
00:01:08,315 --> 00:01:10,846
Are they safe? Where are they?

19
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:49,852
We ran all through the night.

20
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,333
So we must've made it pretty far.

21
00:02:53,203 --> 00:02:56,519
Hey. You'd better
take off your armband.

22
00:02:56,603 --> 00:02:58,452
Someone might notice.

23
00:02:58,536 --> 00:02:59,920
I don't care if they do.

24
00:03:00,004 --> 00:03:03,052
Civilians here don't know
what it means anyway.

25
00:03:03,135 --> 00:03:05,519
Yeah, but a soldier would recognize it.

26
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:07,052
Just take it off to be safe.

27
00:03:07,135 --> 00:03:08,786
Why would a soldier be walking around

28
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,652
out here in the middle of nowhere?

29
00:03:10,736 --> 00:03:12,652
The wrong person will see it eventually.

30
00:03:12,736 --> 00:03:13,586
You don't need it here,

31
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:16,452
and who knows if we'll
make it back to Marley.

32
00:03:16,536 --> 00:03:18,452
I don't plan to make it back.

33
00:03:18,536 --> 00:03:21,052
I just wanna get some answers from Zeke

34
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:23,319
before I'm captured and killed.

35
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:26,652
Why he betrayed us and
why he betrayed Marley.

36
00:03:26,736 --> 00:03:29,452
I just need to find out why he did it.

37
00:03:29,536 --> 00:03:31,052
You can do what you want.

38
00:03:31,135 --> 00:03:33,719
You don't have to follow me.

39
00:03:33,803 --> 00:03:37,586
All right. In that case,
since I can do what I want,

40
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,852
I'll start by trashing your armband.

41
00:03:39,936 --> 00:03:40,768
Give it back!

42
00:03:43,603 --> 00:03:44,986
What's your problem?

43
00:03:45,069 --> 00:03:46,385
That cloth won't help you here

44
00:03:46,469 --> 00:03:47,852
so why do you still wanna wear it?

45
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,652
'Cause it proves I'm
one of the good Eldians!

46
00:03:50,736 --> 00:03:53,452
Without it, I'm no different
than these island devils!

47
00:03:53,536 --> 00:03:54,652
What are you talking about?

48
00:03:54,736 --> 00:03:56,452
You're acting crazy, Gabi!

49
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:58,667
Just leave me alone then!

50
00:04:00,069 --> 00:04:03,000
Why did you even bother following me?

51
00:04:03,804 --> 00:04:06,933
There's no reason for you to die, too.

52
00:04:08,803 --> 00:04:10,467
What are you doing here?

53
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,652
It's so early in the morning.

54
00:04:13,736 --> 00:04:16,001
Where did the two of you even come from?

55
00:04:17,936 --> 00:04:20,452
I-I don't wanna say.

56
00:04:20,536 --> 00:04:25,051
We hated our home, so much that
we decided to run from it.

57
00:04:25,135 --> 00:04:28,567
So. We can't go back.

58
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:33,051
I see. You must be hungry.

59
00:04:33,135 --> 00:04:36,534
I live nearby, so follow me and
we can get you some breakfast.

60
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,652
Wait out here for a minute, okay?

61
00:04:44,736 --> 00:04:45,867
Sure.

62
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:48,986
We should steal horses
and make a break for it.

63
00:04:49,069 --> 00:04:50,786
What are you talking about?

64
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:52,720
They're gonna send soldiers after us.

65
00:04:52,804 --> 00:04:54,986
We haven't run far enough to be safe.

66
00:04:55,069 --> 00:04:57,386
And besides, I'm not about to eat

67
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,586
alongside a bunch of island devils.

68
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,051
Look, I need you to listen.

69
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:03,386
All right! Come on in!

70
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:05,786
'Kay. Thank you!
We'll be right there!

71
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,786
Nevermind, just keep your mouth shut.

72
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,901
I'll do the talking for us both.

73
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,586
Good mornin' to ya.

74
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,985
I hear you're runaways.

75
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:16,319
Mind if I ask your names?

76
00:05:16,403 --> 00:05:17,985
A southern Marleyan accent?

77
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:19,185
Nice to meet you!

78
00:05:19,269 --> 00:05:24,452
My name is Ben, sir,
and my kid sister is named Mia.

79
00:05:24,536 --> 00:05:26,386
I can't say why we ran away.

80
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,586
But if you let us stay here
for just a few days,

81
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,920
we'll do anything around here
that needs doing, sir!

82
00:05:31,003 --> 00:05:33,452
We'll work hard! I promise.

83
00:05:33,536 --> 00:05:35,400
So please take us in!

84
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:40,052
I don't wanna see younguns
like you bowin' your heads.

85
00:05:40,136 --> 00:05:43,386
All are welcome at the Braus Stables.

86
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,519
You can stay as many days as you need.

87
00:05:45,603 --> 00:05:46,786
Table's plenty big,

88
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:49,701
so sit and get yourselves some breakfast.

89
00:05:51,069 --> 00:05:52,720
You two look exhausted.

90
00:05:52,804 --> 00:05:56,000
Maybe you should lie down
once you've eaten your fill.

91
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,586
Lisa. This girl 'ere...

92
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:06,985
I'm sorry. I'm sure y'all have
been through quite a lot.

93
00:06:07,069 --> 00:06:08,386
I, uh...

94
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,720
I'm sorry about her.

95
00:06:09,804 --> 00:06:11,985
Thanks. This looks great!

96
00:06:12,069 --> 00:06:15,652
Ow, wow! It's delicious!

97
00:06:15,736 --> 00:06:17,701
Mmm! So good!

98
00:06:20,069 --> 00:06:22,901
Hey. Hurry and eat, Mia.

99
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:38,452
It seems congratulations are in order,

100
00:06:38,536 --> 00:06:41,586
Premier Zachary.
You bested Marley in battle.

101
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,386
Our leaders back in Hizuru
have nothing but praise

102
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:45,919
for the courage and cunning displayed

103
00:06:46,003 --> 00:06:47,586
by the nation of Eldia.

104
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:50,586
I am honored by your words
and by your presence here.

105
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,386
Welcome to the world's
most dangerous island.

106
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:54,386
Thank you.

107
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,852
That's certainly an apt
description for this place.

108
00:06:56,935 --> 00:06:58,052
And the reason we're here now

109
00:06:58,136 --> 00:07:00,852
is to see that danger for ourselves.

110
00:07:00,935 --> 00:07:02,386
If that's the case,

111
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:04,985
this must be the observation
craft you mentioned.

112
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:05,985
It is.

113
00:07:06,069 --> 00:07:08,852
I believe it's the world's
first flying boat,

114
00:07:08,935 --> 00:07:12,386
made possible by your
island's "iceburst stone."

115
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,386
It should enable us
to get a very good look

116
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:16,985
at the power of the Rumbling.

117
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:19,052
We've heard rumors that
the Anti-Marleyan Volunteers

118
00:07:19,136 --> 00:07:21,452
have been arrested along
with Eren Jaeger himself.

119
00:07:21,536 --> 00:07:22,452
Can you confirm this?

120
00:07:22,536 --> 00:07:25,386
Please, Hange.
Don't leave us in the dark!

121
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:27,052
Why did the military suddenly order us

122
00:07:27,136 --> 00:07:28,851
to evacuate Shiganshina?

123
00:07:28,935 --> 00:07:30,586
You were the ones who
put the Reeves Company

124
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,652
in charge of rebuilding it, remember?

125
00:07:32,736 --> 00:07:33,852
Ask the MPs.

126
00:07:33,936 --> 00:07:36,452
Hange! Eren Jaeger's
victory over Marley

127
00:07:36,536 --> 00:07:38,786
has given Eldians like us a future.

128
00:07:38,869 --> 00:07:41,586
A future where our people
have the right to exist.

129
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,851
If that's the case,
then it's only right that

130
00:07:43,935 --> 00:07:45,851
every Eldian in Paradis
should have a voice

131
00:07:45,935 --> 00:07:47,386
in how Jaeger is handled.

132
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:50,520
As a scout, you said
your job was to explore

133
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,786
and report your findings to us taxpayers.

134
00:07:52,869 --> 00:07:56,652
Are we to assume you
no longer believe this?

135
00:07:56,736 --> 00:07:58,652
The situation has changed.

136
00:07:58,736 --> 00:08:00,052
Now that our walls are open to the world,

137
00:08:00,136 --> 00:08:02,985
we can't trust information
to stay inside them.

138
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:06,786
I know you're in
a tough spot here. I get it.

139
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:10,833
So just look me in the eye
and tell me I can trust you.

140
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:14,786
I can promise you that everything we do,

141
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:17,000
we do for the sake of the people.

142
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,851
So it was the four of you

143
00:08:32,935 --> 00:08:35,052
who leaked these rumors about Eren?

144
00:08:35,136 --> 00:08:38,652
Three recruits:
Holger, Wim, and Louise.

145
00:08:38,736 --> 00:08:41,586
And one veteran: Floch.

146
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:44,785
Care to tell me why you did it?

147
00:08:44,869 --> 00:08:47,520
Because Eren never should've
been imprisoned.

148
00:08:47,604 --> 00:08:50,652
He's done nothing wrong
and should be freed at once.

149
00:08:50,736 --> 00:08:52,985
He challenged a powerful, imposing enemy,

150
00:08:53,069 --> 00:08:54,785
and grasped victory.

151
00:08:54,869 --> 00:08:56,520
We now have the Rumbling.

152
00:08:56,604 --> 00:08:58,919
A power which secures our right to live.

153
00:08:59,003 --> 00:09:00,919
Eren Jaeger is no criminal.

154
00:09:01,003 --> 00:09:02,452
He's a war hero.

155
00:09:02,536 --> 00:09:04,452
And he just saved
the life of every person

156
00:09:04,536 --> 00:09:06,386
in the New Eldian Empire.

157
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,452
The Nation of Eldia is
in greater danger than ever.

158
00:09:09,536 --> 00:09:12,520
We don't know if the Rumbling
can protect us yet or not.

159
00:09:12,604 --> 00:09:13,785
Nobody knows how it works,

160
00:09:13,869 --> 00:09:15,852
it's still just a myth at this point.

161
00:09:15,936 --> 00:09:18,833
Only because you're
keeping Eren locked in a cage.

162
00:09:20,869 --> 00:09:22,652
At the very least,
I hope you'll agree that

163
00:09:22,735 --> 00:09:25,586
we can't afford to waste time right now.

164
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,319
We need to be decisive.

165
00:09:27,403 --> 00:09:29,386
To make use of our victory.

166
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,919
It will be Eren Jaeger
who leads this nation.

167
00:09:32,003 --> 00:09:34,900
Please see reason and
release him at once.

168
00:09:36,869 --> 00:09:41,386
Yeah. You might just
be right about that.

169
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,985
From a certain viewpoint.

170
00:09:43,069 --> 00:09:44,052
I've already made the decision

171
00:09:44,136 --> 00:09:46,785
to see Zeke Jaeger's plan
through to the end.

172
00:09:46,869 --> 00:09:49,852
I'm responsible for making that choice.

173
00:09:49,936 --> 00:09:53,919
Which is why I can't
tolerate insubordination.

174
00:09:54,003 --> 00:09:55,652
You will all be tried for the crime of

175
00:09:55,735 --> 00:09:58,052
leaking confidential intelligence.

176
00:09:58,136 --> 00:10:00,300
Detain them in the meantime.

177
00:10:02,136 --> 00:10:04,319
If this is the price of serving humanity

178
00:10:04,403 --> 00:10:07,967
within the walls, then so be it.

179
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,319
There's an order to these things.

180
00:10:17,403 --> 00:10:19,852
Perhaps it's a law of human nature.

181
00:10:19,936 --> 00:10:21,986
When one's time is over,

182
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:25,700
another must take on the role
that they used to play.

183
00:10:26,669 --> 00:10:29,501
Best of luck, Hange.

184
00:10:36,936 --> 00:10:38,733
I'm pooped.

185
00:10:41,803 --> 00:10:46,367
No. There's more
I need to investigate.

186
00:10:50,803 --> 00:10:51,852
This may sound strange,

187
00:10:51,936 --> 00:10:54,586
but have you ever been
in this cell, Mikasa?

188
00:10:54,669 --> 00:10:56,586
Uh... No, I haven't.

189
00:10:56,669 --> 00:11:00,586
Well, that's too bad.
I had kind of hoped.

190
00:11:00,669 --> 00:11:03,586
Either way, I have no regrets
about leaking that intel.

191
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:05,651
The Scout regiment's goal is victory.

192
00:11:05,735 --> 00:11:07,852
And if military law becomes
an obstacle to that goal,

193
00:11:07,936 --> 00:11:09,785
there's nothing to do
but bend the rules, right?

194
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:11,719
Don't talk like that, Louise.

195
00:11:11,803 --> 00:11:14,133
You'll just extend your sentence.

196
00:11:14,869 --> 00:11:18,452
About four years have passed
since you saved me from a Titan,

197
00:11:18,536 --> 00:11:20,852
and nothing has changed for me.

198
00:11:20,936 --> 00:11:23,052
I watched you bring one of them down

199
00:11:23,136 --> 00:11:25,586
with nothing but human strength.

200
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:29,452
And realized that you can't
protect others without power.

201
00:11:29,536 --> 00:11:32,719
That it's okay to fight
against senseless violence.

202
00:11:32,803 --> 00:11:34,852
It's necessary.

203
00:11:34,936 --> 00:11:36,386
Ever since that day,

204
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,520
I've hoped I'd get a chance
to get closer to you.

205
00:11:39,603 --> 00:11:41,234
That's why I...

206
00:11:47,003 --> 00:11:48,651
Tell me, Mikasa.

207
00:11:48,735 --> 00:11:50,986
Why did you join the Scout Regiment?

208
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,852
If it was for Jaeger,
you should set him fr...

209
00:11:52,936 --> 00:11:55,052
I only have one thing to say to you.

210
00:11:55,136 --> 00:11:57,667
Keep your mouth shut, Louise.

211
00:12:19,536 --> 00:12:21,301
You're safe now.

212
00:12:23,603 --> 00:12:24,667
Mikasa.

213
00:12:31,739 --> 00:12:33,455
Ten months ago,

214
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:37,056
during the celebration of the
opening of the Trost Railway.

215
00:12:37,139 --> 00:12:38,522
The guard assigned to watch over you

216
00:12:38,606 --> 00:12:41,056
was changed at the last minute.

217
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:43,455
Changed to Floch Forster.

218
00:12:43,539 --> 00:12:46,321
Whilst everyone else was
busy enjoying the festivities,

219
00:12:46,405 --> 00:12:49,189
Forster accompanied you to your lodgings.

220
00:12:49,273 --> 00:12:53,189
He's since been charged with
divulging military secrets.

221
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,722
I thought to check and
it turns out that your lodgings

222
00:12:55,806 --> 00:13:00,056
were just a few dozen
kilometers from Eren Jaeger's.

223
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:02,255
It also turns out to be around then

224
00:13:02,339 --> 00:13:06,255
that we started to see Eren
take more unauthorized actions.

225
00:13:06,339 --> 00:13:08,056
On the bright side,

226
00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:12,103
this means I have an excuse to
speak with a beautiful woman.

227
00:13:32,139 --> 00:13:34,503
Gabi. Gabi!

228
00:13:37,273 --> 00:13:40,522
Gabi!

229
00:13:40,606 --> 00:13:43,522
Why is this happening to me?

230
00:13:43,606 --> 00:13:47,321
I know. This is
the devil's doing!

231
00:13:47,405 --> 00:13:50,236
No. I think the horse
was working alone.

232
00:13:52,739 --> 00:13:54,389
You know, there
probably isn't a horse here

233
00:13:54,473 --> 00:13:56,121
that would let you ride on it.

234
00:13:56,205 --> 00:13:59,522
I never learned to ride anyway,
so it doesn't matter.

235
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:03,321
We won't learn anything if we
stay out here in the sticks.

236
00:14:03,405 --> 00:14:04,722
Yeah, but we're better off laying low

237
00:14:04,806 --> 00:14:07,321
than roaming around, for now at least.

238
00:14:07,405 --> 00:14:09,321
What's that supposed to mean?

239
00:14:09,405 --> 00:14:12,522
I think we can just hang
tight and wait for help.

240
00:14:12,606 --> 00:14:13,455
It's only a matter of time before

241
00:14:13,539 --> 00:14:16,121
Marley and the rest of the world attack.

242
00:14:16,205 --> 00:14:18,189
When they do, I bet that
Reiner and my brother

243
00:14:18,273 --> 00:14:19,522
will come and rescue us.

244
00:14:19,606 --> 00:14:21,389
Aren't you pissed at Zeke?

245
00:14:21,473 --> 00:14:23,922
All this time, we've had
a traitor right next to us!

246
00:14:24,006 --> 00:14:27,970
Uh... There's nothing we can do about it.

247
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:34,321
Where the hell didja get
the name "Mia" from?

248
00:14:34,405 --> 00:14:36,655
And why'd you call me your "kid" sister?

249
00:14:36,739 --> 00:14:39,055
Does it really matter?

250
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:42,437
Hey, you two.
Ready for a lunch break?

251
00:14:45,006 --> 00:14:46,989
Both of you are quick learners.

252
00:14:47,072 --> 00:14:48,255
You're hard-working, too.

253
00:14:48,339 --> 00:14:51,922
You think? Thanks for saying so.

254
00:14:52,005 --> 00:14:53,722
Hey, Kaya, I wanted to ask you.

255
00:14:53,806 --> 00:14:55,722
Is there a reason why everyone
who works at this place

256
00:14:55,806 --> 00:14:56,722
is so young?

257
00:14:56,806 --> 00:15:00,522
Yeah. For the most part,
we're all orphans.

258
00:15:00,606 --> 00:15:02,522
Oh. I see.

259
00:15:02,606 --> 00:15:04,589
The queen's policies
provide a lot of support

260
00:15:04,673 --> 00:15:06,856
to children with nowhere to go.

261
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,722
Most of the kids who
live here at the stables

262
00:15:08,806 --> 00:15:11,121
lost our parents four years ago.

263
00:15:11,205 --> 00:15:13,653
You haven't acknowledged
your guilt yet, have you?

264
00:15:14,606 --> 00:15:16,655
You people can cover it up
and try to forget,

265
00:15:16,739 --> 00:15:18,455
but you've committed horrific atrocities

266
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:20,522
against the entire world.

267
00:15:20,606 --> 00:15:22,255
There's only one way for an Eldian

268
00:15:22,339 --> 00:15:24,255
to start down the path towards atonement.

269
00:15:24,339 --> 00:15:27,522
And that's to recognize that
you are tainted with sin.

270
00:15:27,606 --> 00:15:29,522
Are you saying this
'cause it has to do with

271
00:15:29,606 --> 00:15:31,321
why we lost our parents?

272
00:15:31,405 --> 00:15:32,255
Of course it does.

273
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:34,255
Even if you act like
a saint your whole life,

274
00:15:34,339 --> 00:15:37,321
you'll never escape from
the shadow of Eldia's sins.

275
00:15:37,405 --> 00:15:39,255
[KAYA] I guess that's what they
teach you back in Marley?

276
00:15:37,405 --> 00:15:40,322
{\an8} [FLACO]Why you say something like this when someone who's helping us?

277
00:15:40,406 --> 00:15:41,322
These are indisputable truths!

278
00:15:41,406 --> 00:15:43,522
[GABI] She needs to be told.
[FLACO] Please don't do this.

279
00:15:43,606 --> 00:15:45,322
Whoa, wait a minute,
what did you just say?

280
00:15:45,406 --> 00:15:49,121
You're on the run because
you're from Marley, right?

281
00:15:49,205 --> 00:15:50,522
How did you know?

282
00:15:50,606 --> 00:15:52,255
Do you really have to ask?

283
00:15:52,339 --> 00:15:54,522
You were yelling about going back.

284
00:15:54,606 --> 00:15:57,922
Wait. So then,
you knew from the start?

285
00:15:58,005 --> 00:15:59,322
Aww man.

286
00:15:59,406 --> 00:16:01,255
From the moment we first met?

287
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:02,856
This is seriously embarrassing.

288
00:16:02,939 --> 00:16:04,656
Why didn't you say something about it?

289
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,870
Jeez. You're so sneaky.

290
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:17,055
What do you think you're doing?

291
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:18,055
Take a guess!

292
00:16:18,139 --> 00:16:19,589
She just showed her true colors!

293
00:16:19,673 --> 00:16:21,522
I knew something was up with her!

294
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:24,121
There's no way an island devil
would actually be that nice!

295
00:16:24,205 --> 00:16:25,455
Stop! Don't be stupid!

296
00:16:25,539 --> 00:16:26,455
Hey!

297
00:16:26,539 --> 00:16:28,670
What're you two fighting about?

298
00:16:29,606 --> 00:16:30,389
This is bad.

299
00:16:30,473 --> 00:16:32,589
Mia thinks I'm stealing her brother.

300
00:16:32,673 --> 00:16:35,656
I think she's jealous or something!

301
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,389
It looks like
Kaya's actually making friends.

302
00:16:38,473 --> 00:16:40,522
I guess she's cheered up some.

303
00:16:40,606 --> 00:16:42,121
Good grief.

304
00:16:42,205 --> 00:16:45,255
Well, don't horse around with
that pitchfork, it's sharp!

305
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:47,003
Right. Sorry!

306
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:51,370
Why?

307
00:16:54,406 --> 00:16:57,322
This village used to be my home.

308
00:16:57,406 --> 00:17:00,522
Four years ago, a Titan showed up here.

309
00:17:00,606 --> 00:17:02,055
It was only a small one,

310
00:17:02,139 --> 00:17:05,121
but everyone still ran when they saw it.

311
00:17:05,205 --> 00:17:08,121
Everyone except for my mother,
who couldn't run.

312
00:17:08,205 --> 00:17:12,055
There was nothing I
could do, so I just sat.

313
00:17:12,139 --> 00:17:13,856
Right at this spot.

314
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:15,522
I sat still and listened to the sound

315
00:17:15,606 --> 00:17:18,189
of that Titan eating my mother.

316
00:17:18,273 --> 00:17:22,121
She was alive the entire
time it was happening,

317
00:17:22,205 --> 00:17:25,121
but after a while,
she went mostly silent.

318
00:17:25,205 --> 00:17:28,203
Think she lost her voice
from all the screaming.

319
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:31,589
We've been told that
outside of the walls,

320
00:17:31,673 --> 00:17:35,255
the majority of people
think we're a race of devils.

321
00:17:35,339 --> 00:17:37,589
But I don't understand
how people we've never met

322
00:17:37,673 --> 00:17:39,855
can hate us so much.

323
00:17:39,939 --> 00:17:42,722
So please. Help me. Explain it.

324
00:17:42,806 --> 00:17:45,455
What have we ever done to them?

325
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:48,121
What did my mom do
to make these people hate her?

326
00:17:48,205 --> 00:17:51,455
For thousands
of years, your kind brutalized

327
00:17:51,539 --> 00:17:53,656
and slaughtered people
all over the world!

328
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:54,722
Thousands of years?

329
00:17:54,806 --> 00:17:57,456
How could you have
let yourselves forget this?

330
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,589
Eldians used the Power of
the Titans to crush the world

331
00:18:00,673 --> 00:18:03,455
beneath their heels for
millennia, understand?

332
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:05,522
They wiped out other people's cultures,

333
00:18:05,606 --> 00:18:08,055
forced those people
to bear their children,

334
00:18:08,139 --> 00:18:10,989
and took more innocent lives
than you could possibly imagine!

335
00:18:11,073 --> 00:18:13,055
So stop playing like you're the victim!

336
00:18:13,139 --> 00:18:15,989
But my mother spent her
whole life here on this island.

337
00:18:16,073 --> 00:18:18,455
She couldn't have had
anything to do with all that.

338
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:19,455
Listen to me!

339
00:18:19,539 --> 00:18:22,189
A century ago,
your ancestors ruled the world

340
00:18:22,273 --> 00:18:24,255
by doing awful, unforgivable things!

341
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:28,255
A century ago? Okay, but what
about the people here now?

342
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:30,989
What unforgivable things have we done?

343
00:18:31,073 --> 00:18:32,522
You attacked Marley the other day.

344
00:18:32,606 --> 00:18:34,456
Your soldiers devastated my home.

345
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:35,456
But that was recent,

346
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,989
and my mom was killed
four whole years ago.

347
00:18:38,073 --> 00:18:39,455
So that's not her fault.

348
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:41,522
The point is your ancestors slaughtered

349
00:18:41,606 --> 00:18:43,121
countless people all over the world!

350
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,456
But my mother didn't kill anybody!

351
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:48,055
Tell me! Why'd she have to die?

352
00:18:48,139 --> 00:18:50,189
She never hurt a soul, so why?

353
00:18:50,273 --> 00:18:52,855
It must've been for something, right?

354
00:18:52,939 --> 00:18:54,722
It doesn't make sense otherwise!

355
00:18:54,805 --> 00:18:56,722
Is the world we live in
just that horrible

356
00:18:56,805 --> 00:18:58,122
or was there a reason?

357
00:18:58,206 --> 00:19:00,855
Spit it out! Why was
my mom eaten alive?!

358
00:19:00,939 --> 00:19:04,070
Tell me! Tell me why!

359
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,055
Reconnaissance-in-force.

360
00:19:08,139 --> 00:19:09,722
The incursion four years ago was part of

361
00:19:09,805 --> 00:19:12,456
a recon mission to
gauge Paradis' strength

362
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,589
and prepare for a larger attack.

363
00:19:15,673 --> 00:19:18,537
You and your mother just
happened to get caught up in it.

364
00:19:19,273 --> 00:19:23,322
Your mom was innocent,
she didn't deserve that.

365
00:19:23,406 --> 00:19:24,870
I'm sorry.

366
00:19:27,739 --> 00:19:30,121
You're leaking secrets to the enemy now?

367
00:19:30,205 --> 00:19:32,537
Why the hell did you apologize?

368
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,589
Thank you for telling me, Ben.

369
00:19:35,673 --> 00:19:37,855
I'm glad to know.

370
00:19:37,939 --> 00:19:41,255
But um, you don't have to
apologize for Marley.

371
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:43,936
I mean you just happened
to be born there.

372
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,055
Hey, Kaya.

373
00:19:48,139 --> 00:19:49,456
If you were trapped in here with a Titan,

374
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,322
how did you manage to escape?

375
00:19:51,406 --> 00:19:53,189
A girl not much older than I am

376
00:19:53,273 --> 00:19:54,721
saw what was happening,

377
00:19:54,805 --> 00:19:58,122
grabbed an axe from our yard,
and came in swinging.

378
00:19:58,206 --> 00:19:59,656
She saved me.

379
00:19:59,739 --> 00:20:02,122
No way! For real?

380
00:20:02,206 --> 00:20:05,589
Yeah. She put herself
between me and the Titan,

381
00:20:05,673 --> 00:20:08,170
and held it off so I could escape.

382
00:20:09,739 --> 00:20:11,522
If she was still alive,

383
00:20:11,606 --> 00:20:16,255
she would never abandon two
lost kids with nowhere to run.

384
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:18,970
She'd help you, just like she helped me.

385
00:20:20,606 --> 00:20:23,122
Mr. Braus was invited
to go to a restaurant

386
00:20:23,206 --> 00:20:25,189
where a Marleyan works.

387
00:20:25,273 --> 00:20:28,522
If the two of you join us,
then maybe that Marleyan

388
00:20:28,606 --> 00:20:31,322
can help you to find a way back home.

389
00:20:31,406 --> 00:20:33,322
Why do this?

390
00:20:33,406 --> 00:20:37,136
It's simple. I wanna be
the kind of person she was.

391
00:21:40,073 --> 00:21:42,922
We investigated the Beast Titan's remains

392
00:21:43,006 --> 00:21:44,256
and managed to locate a number of

393
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,903
Zeke Jaeger's severed body parts.

394
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:49,655
But no. Not enough.

395
00:21:49,739 --> 00:21:51,322
Just his arms and legs.

396
00:21:51,406 --> 00:21:54,189
This effectively confirms our theory:

397
00:21:54,273 --> 00:21:56,989
Zeke conspired with the
enemy to stage his death

398
00:21:57,073 --> 00:22:00,456
in order to hide the fact that
he has defected to their side.

399
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,122
We now believe that Zeke is the traitor

400
00:22:02,206 --> 00:22:04,721
we have long suspected
to be among our ranks.

401
00:22:04,805 --> 00:22:09,255
This here is the Anti-Personnel
ODM gear used to attack us.

402
00:22:09,339 --> 00:22:11,721
It utilizes Marleyan tech.

403
00:22:11,805 --> 00:22:12,456
Then there's the matter of

404
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,522
how they escaped on a stolen airship.

405
00:22:15,605 --> 00:22:16,922
Only a veteran pilot could've

406
00:22:17,006 --> 00:22:19,322
executed such advanced maneuvers.

407
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:21,456
Zeke must've snuck his co-conspirators

408
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,522
onto the first Survey Fleet
we sent to Paradis.

409
00:22:24,605 --> 00:22:28,589
A handpicked cell of
Eldian Restorationists.

410
00:22:28,673 --> 00:22:32,055
Shit. To think
we fought side-by-side

411
00:22:32,139 --> 00:22:34,122
with a traitor this whole time.

412
00:22:34,206 --> 00:22:37,256
Of course, we're not
about to let it end here.

413
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,122
As part of a global alliance,

414
00:22:39,206 --> 00:22:41,055
we'll launch a scorched-earth campaign

415
00:22:41,139 --> 00:22:43,322
against Paradis within six months.

416
00:22:43,406 --> 00:22:45,322
Wait. We're waiting that long?

417
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:48,870
We're not gonna try to save
Falco and Gabi for six months?

418
00:22:49,805 --> 00:22:51,055
They're the most talented

419
00:22:51,139 --> 00:22:53,322
Warrior candidates we have, sir.

420
00:22:53,406 --> 00:22:55,521
If we lost them before
they even got to inherit,

421
00:22:55,605 --> 00:22:57,521
it would be a major blow to Marley.

422
00:22:57,605 --> 00:23:00,055
Training new candidates
isn't just expensive.

423
00:23:00,139 --> 00:23:02,521
It also takes a number
of years to do right.

424
00:23:02,605 --> 00:23:04,322
That's true, but if Marley attempts

425
00:23:04,406 --> 00:23:06,322
to attack Paradis without backup,

426
00:23:06,406 --> 00:23:09,055
we'll only be driven back
like we were before.

427
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:12,122
We must wait for the
allied forces to gather.

428
00:23:12,206 --> 00:23:14,389
That's exactly what Zeke hopes we'll do.

429
00:23:14,473 --> 00:23:17,122
He's betting that Marley won't
dare launch a counterattack

430
00:23:17,206 --> 00:23:20,122
right after taking such a heavy blow.

431
00:23:20,206 --> 00:23:22,122
If we give him half a year to prepare,

432
00:23:22,206 --> 00:23:24,736
he'll fight back
in ways we can't predict.

433
00:23:25,605 --> 00:23:29,721
We can't afford to
wait for the global alliance!

434
00:23:29,805 --> 00:23:31,322
We have no choice.

435
00:23:31,406 --> 00:23:33,837
We need to attack them at once.

436
00:23:41,139 --> 00:23:44,055
How should one decide who to hate?

437
00:23:44,139 --> 00:23:46,855
How should one decide what to blame?

438
00:23:46,939 --> 00:23:49,122
By now, you would think that one would be

439
00:23:49,206 --> 00:23:51,456
used to the shifting of truth.

440
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:54,536
Next episode: "Guides."
