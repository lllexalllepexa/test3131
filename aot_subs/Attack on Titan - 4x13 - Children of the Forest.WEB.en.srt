1
00:00:27,205 --> 00:00:29,722
It's called a "gas weapon."

2
00:00:29,806 --> 00:00:33,322
The gas was made with
some of my spinal fluid.

3
00:00:33,406 --> 00:00:35,188
Inhaling even a small amount

4
00:00:35,272 --> 00:00:37,588
makes any Subjects of Ymir freeze up,

5
00:00:37,672 --> 00:00:42,321
lose control of their bodies,
and then fall unconscious.

6
00:00:42,405 --> 00:00:45,322
This also etches
a coordinate inside them.

7
00:00:45,406 --> 00:00:47,722
I use this path to send
the Power of the Titans

8
00:00:47,806 --> 00:00:49,703
to said coordinate.

9
00:00:51,406 --> 00:00:53,188
And that's why the people of that village

10
00:00:53,272 --> 00:00:55,588
transformed into obedient Titans.

11
00:00:55,672 --> 00:00:58,922
It was called "Ragako."
Not "that village."

12
00:00:59,005 --> 00:01:01,856
And seeing as you murdered
every person who lived there,

13
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:04,522
you should learn the name,
you bearded shit.

14
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:07,722
Look. It's not like
I wanted to do it.

15
00:01:07,806 --> 00:01:10,788
I just did what was needed
to convince the Marleyans

16
00:01:10,872 --> 00:01:12,322
that I was loyal to them.

17
00:01:12,406 --> 00:01:13,255
If they'd learned the truth,

18
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:16,322
I never could've brought
hope to this island.

19
00:01:16,406 --> 00:01:17,588
None of this is new to you, though.

20
00:01:17,672 --> 00:01:21,388
I told you guys the exact same
thing when I first got here.

21
00:01:21,472 --> 00:01:23,921
Why do you keep asking me about it?

22
00:01:24,005 --> 00:01:25,856
Because I can see that
you aren't burdened

23
00:01:25,939 --> 00:01:28,856
by a shred of guilt
over what you've done.

24
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:32,121
I still can't tell if you
actually wanna save Eldia,

25
00:01:32,205 --> 00:01:35,722
but it's clear that those lives
meant nothing to you.

26
00:01:35,806 --> 00:01:38,255
Doubt you were well-liked by the ladies.

27
00:01:38,339 --> 00:01:39,656
Considering how you think you know

28
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,322
what everyone else is feeling.

29
00:01:42,406 --> 00:01:47,322
I do know. And I
was liked enough. So...

30
00:01:47,406 --> 00:01:48,788
Well good for you!

31
00:01:48,872 --> 00:01:50,788
Anyway, when are you
gonna let me meet with Eren

32
00:01:50,872 --> 00:01:53,322
so we can run our experiment?

33
00:01:53,406 --> 00:01:55,388
That isn't my call to make.

34
00:01:55,472 --> 00:01:57,322
We're waiting for HQ.

35
00:01:57,406 --> 00:02:00,255
If your commanders think
that they have time to spare,

36
00:02:00,339 --> 00:02:01,921
then they couldn't be more wrong.

37
00:02:02,005 --> 00:02:03,921
On that one point, we agree.

38
00:02:04,005 --> 00:02:05,503
Captain Levi!

39
00:02:07,406 --> 00:02:09,803
What? Are you serious?

40
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:48,910
This building's so big!

41
00:03:48,994 --> 00:03:50,910
I've never seen anything like it!

42
00:03:50,994 --> 00:03:52,109
Neither have I!

43
00:03:52,193 --> 00:03:54,109
It must be your lucky day.

44
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:56,709
Y'all ready for some fancy dinin'?

45
00:03:56,793 --> 00:03:57,842
Yeah!

46
00:03:57,926 --> 00:04:00,642
What's the matter, Mia?
You got the jitters?

47
00:04:00,726 --> 00:04:02,842
Uh. No, I'm fine. Thanks.

48
00:04:02,926 --> 00:04:04,709
All this fancy stuff make you nervous?

49
00:04:04,793 --> 00:04:06,041
I knew you were country kids,

50
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:07,576
but I didn't know it was this bad.

51
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,642
No. I... Kaya.

52
00:04:09,726 --> 00:04:11,776
Is there actually
a Marleyan prisoner of war

53
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,041
working at this place?

54
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,710
Yeah, he's here for sure, so get a grip.

55
00:04:15,794 --> 00:04:17,976
And watch out 'cause
soldiers eat here, too.

56
00:04:18,059 --> 00:04:20,442
Even if this prisoner
can't help us get out,

57
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:21,957
he'll be good to know.

58
00:04:23,059 --> 00:04:26,576
Mr. Braus! I'm glad that
you were able to come.

59
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,590
So am I. Thanks for
the invitation.

60
00:04:33,059 --> 00:04:35,776
Wow. Look at all these kids.

61
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,776
You brought quite the crowd with you.

62
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,910
Figured I might as well
bring the whole family.

63
00:04:39,994 --> 00:04:42,976
You did say it was "on the
house." Right, Nicolo?

64
00:04:43,059 --> 00:04:45,842
Yes. All of you are
welcome here.

65
00:04:45,926 --> 00:04:46,910
Come. This way.

66
00:04:46,994 --> 00:04:49,657
I'm really hungry, dad!

67
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:54,842
That chef named Nicolo is the
Marleyan who invited us here.

68
00:04:54,926 --> 00:04:57,041
See if he can help you.

69
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,776
Why was someone like Mr. Braus
invited to eat here anyway?

70
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,642
I mean he's not a soldier.

71
00:05:01,726 --> 00:05:05,576
The Braus's eldest was the girl
who saved me from a Titan.

72
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,041
They met Nicolo at her grave,
and got to talking.

73
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,442
She loved his cooking,
so he offered to treat them

74
00:05:10,526 --> 00:05:12,776
to the meal he'll never get to make her.

75
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,442
He didn't say this, but personally,

76
00:05:15,526 --> 00:05:16,923
I think they were in love.

77
00:05:21,526 --> 00:05:23,776
Ben? What's the matter?

78
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,442
You got a stomach bug or somethin'?

79
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:27,324
No. I'm fine.

80
00:05:30,993 --> 00:05:35,023
Delicious! I've never had a meal
this good in my whole life!

81
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,442
Well, if you like that,

82
00:05:38,526 --> 00:05:41,390
then just wait till
you get to the main dish!

83
00:05:43,126 --> 00:05:45,376
Nicolo, you've got more guests.

84
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,824
Huh? Who's here at this hour?

85
00:05:48,993 --> 00:05:50,923
The Scout Regiment.

86
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,776
Hello there. This urgent?
Sorry, but...

87
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,910
I'm preparing a main course for

88
00:05:56,993 --> 00:05:58,910
some very important guests right now.

89
00:05:58,993 --> 00:06:00,842
That's fine. If you're
in the middle of something,

90
00:06:00,925 --> 00:06:02,175
you can get back to it.

91
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:04,776
But, we'd like to have
a quick word with you

92
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,576
once you finish up.

93
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,576
You wanna talk?
What is this about?

94
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,842
We wondered if you might
have some concerns.

95
00:06:12,925 --> 00:06:15,642
The scouts're investigating
our detainment.

96
00:06:15,726 --> 00:06:18,509
We were hoping you'd be able to help us.

97
00:06:18,593 --> 00:06:20,957
Yeah. No problem.

98
00:06:22,593 --> 00:06:24,842
I'll ask you to wait in
here until I can finish.

99
00:06:24,925 --> 00:06:27,776
Wow. This room is pretty fancy.

100
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,576
I bet it's usually reserved for MPs.

101
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,376
Hey. I've heard
a whole lotta talk

102
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,376
about this wine. It's so
nice that it's only served

103
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,442
to high-ranking members of the military.

104
00:06:38,526 --> 00:06:39,642
Oh yeah?

105
00:06:39,726 --> 00:06:41,710
Well, aren't we high-ranking
members of the Scouts?

106
00:06:41,794 --> 00:06:42,842
Sure are!

107
00:06:42,925 --> 00:06:45,442
I'd say we've earned
a quick sip of liquid luxury.

108
00:06:45,526 --> 00:06:46,442
Let's have a little...

109
00:06:46,526 --> 00:06:48,023
Don't touch that!

110
00:06:50,259 --> 00:06:52,042
Whoa, calm down, man.

111
00:06:52,126 --> 00:06:54,509
We were just screwing around, so relax.

112
00:06:54,593 --> 00:06:56,857
No need to make a big thing of it.

113
00:06:57,925 --> 00:07:00,975
A wine of this quality would be
wasted on Eldians, understand?

114
00:07:01,059 --> 00:07:03,109
- -What?
- -What's with you?

115
00:07:03,193 --> 00:07:05,776
I can't believe you're
still spouting that crap.

116
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:06,975
Regardless of what you've been told,

117
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,975
your wine doesn't care what race we are!

118
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:11,642
Get your hands off me, Eldian.

119
00:07:11,726 --> 00:07:15,509
I've been civil to you, but that
doesn't make us friends.

120
00:07:15,593 --> 00:07:17,843
It sounds to me like you've
forgotten your place here.

121
00:07:17,926 --> 00:07:18,975
On this island, you're just...

122
00:07:19,059 --> 00:07:21,642
Just a filthy POW?

123
00:07:21,726 --> 00:07:24,490
Guess that makes us even,
you Eldian devil.

124
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:30,576
What is that guy's problem?

125
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,524
Hell if I know. Whatever!

126
00:07:39,393 --> 00:07:40,776
'Kay. Now. Go for it!

127
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:42,975
My stomach hurts real bad!

128
00:07:43,059 --> 00:07:44,376
Is there some way we can help?

129
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:46,576
Don't tell me it's
'cause of something you ate.

130
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,975
I should be okay, but I'm
gonna go to the restroom.

131
00:07:49,059 --> 00:07:50,109
I'll go with him.

132
00:07:50,193 --> 00:07:52,576
Just in case something goes
wrong while he's in there.

133
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,857
Good luck.

134
00:08:02,726 --> 00:08:06,442
Hey, uh. The restroom
is the other way.

135
00:08:06,526 --> 00:08:08,710
That's not what we're here for, Nicolo.

136
00:08:08,793 --> 00:08:10,975
We're warrior candidates from Marley.

137
00:08:11,059 --> 00:08:13,042
And we're in hiding right now.

138
00:08:13,126 --> 00:08:14,242
Huh?

139
00:08:14,326 --> 00:08:15,309
We have reason to
believe that this island

140
00:08:15,393 --> 00:08:18,042
is about to be invaded by
an allied army made up of

141
00:08:18,126 --> 00:08:19,841
every major country in the world.

142
00:08:19,925 --> 00:08:22,042
Until that army comes,
just hang in there!

143
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,442
And also, spread the word
to any other Marleyan

144
00:08:24,526 --> 00:08:25,841
captives you know!

145
00:08:25,925 --> 00:08:27,841
Wait. Take it back a few steps.

146
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:29,576
How'd a pair of Warrior
Candidates like you

147
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:30,642
even get here?

148
00:08:30,726 --> 00:08:33,841
These island devils raided
Liberio about a month ago.

149
00:08:33,925 --> 00:08:35,442
This might be hard to believe,

150
00:08:35,526 --> 00:08:37,376
but we actually fought
our way onto the airship

151
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,390
they used to retreat
and got taken prisoner.

152
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,042
Did you kill anyone?

153
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:49,457
A female... soldier?

154
00:08:50,926 --> 00:08:52,576
Yeah. I brought her down!

155
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:55,442
I've only rid the world of
a few devils so far.

156
00:08:55,526 --> 00:08:56,775
But I give you my word.

157
00:08:56,859 --> 00:08:58,842
Our real revenge hasn't even started yet!

158
00:08:58,926 --> 00:09:00,642
Help's coming. And when
the army gets here...

159
00:09:00,726 --> 00:09:02,576
Hey. Stop!

160
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,376
What is it?

161
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:07,523
It was you. You killed her.

162
00:09:08,526 --> 00:09:10,923
You're the little wretch
who murdered Sasha!

163
00:09:22,725 --> 00:09:27,842
Falco? Hey. Falco!

164
00:09:27,926 --> 00:09:30,576
Falco. Are you okay?

165
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,510
Falco. Falco!

166
00:09:32,594 --> 00:09:34,975
Get up! Hey! Wake up!

167
00:09:35,059 --> 00:09:37,042
Shit. Shit!

168
00:09:37,126 --> 00:09:38,424
Falco!

169
00:09:43,926 --> 00:09:48,842
Wha... Nicolo! What're you
doin' to Ben and Mia?

170
00:09:48,926 --> 00:09:52,042
"Mia" here's been
keeping secrets from you.

171
00:09:52,126 --> 00:09:54,990
One being that she was
the one who murdered Sasha.

172
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,842
She may be a kid,

173
00:09:58,926 --> 00:10:01,576
but she's also a trained
Marleyan soldier.

174
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:04,442
She climbed aboard the Scout's
airship as it left Marley

175
00:10:04,526 --> 00:10:06,642
and shot Sasha in cold blood.

176
00:10:06,725 --> 00:10:08,642
She's the reason your daughter's gone.

177
00:10:08,725 --> 00:10:10,990
Your daughter?

178
00:10:14,126 --> 00:10:16,709
Take it, Mr. Braus. Go ahead.

179
00:10:16,793 --> 00:10:18,042
If you can't bring yourself to kill her,

180
00:10:18,126 --> 00:10:19,842
then I can do it for you.

181
00:10:19,926 --> 00:10:21,923
As the father, it's your call.

182
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:28,976
Wha... What's going on in here?

183
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,842
Everybody hurry over!

184
00:10:30,926 --> 00:10:33,057
Huh? What is it?

185
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:36,442
That's the kid who shot Sasha!

186
00:10:36,526 --> 00:10:38,176
I heard she was on the run,

187
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,641
but I'm surprised you recognized her.

188
00:10:40,725 --> 00:10:43,176
Wait, what are you planning to do here?

189
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,442
Stay away from me! You hear?

190
00:10:45,526 --> 00:10:47,042
I'm just going to avenge Sasha.

191
00:10:47,126 --> 00:10:48,757
That's all I want!

192
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:54,842
Stop. Leave Falco
out of this, please!

193
00:10:54,926 --> 00:10:57,176
What, is this brat
someone special to you?

194
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,775
Is that why he tried
to protect you earlier?

195
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:01,376
You care about him, huh?

196
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,510
Well, I used to care about someone, too!

197
00:11:03,594 --> 00:11:06,576
A dirt-blooded Eldian!
A descendant of devils!

198
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:07,976
A woman who enjoyed the food I cooked

199
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,109
more than anyone I'd ever met before!

200
00:11:11,193 --> 00:11:14,842
She saved me from this
shitty-ass, pointless war!

201
00:11:14,926 --> 00:11:16,842
She showed me that
the person I'm meant to be

202
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,975
is a man who brings people
happiness through his cooking.

203
00:11:20,059 --> 00:11:21,775
Her name was Sasha Braus.

204
00:11:21,859 --> 00:11:23,042
She was amazing.

205
00:11:23,126 --> 00:11:25,976
And you stole her from me!

206
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,775
I've lost people, too.

207
00:11:27,859 --> 00:11:30,442
Your Sasha Braus
shot two friends of mine!

208
00:11:30,526 --> 00:11:32,775
She gunned them both down as
they were protecting their home!

209
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,976
That's why I took revenge on her!

210
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,641
She's the one who started it!

211
00:11:36,725 --> 00:11:39,842
Shut the hell up!
Who cares how it started?

212
00:11:39,926 --> 00:11:41,442
Wake up! Open your eyes!

213
00:11:41,526 --> 00:11:43,842
You're supposed to be a Marleyan soldier!

214
00:11:43,926 --> 00:11:46,442
That she-devil must've
bewitched you somehow.

215
00:11:46,526 --> 00:11:49,391
Fight! Don't let the devils win!

216
00:11:50,394 --> 00:11:53,656
All right, Nicolo.
Gimme that knife.

217
00:11:58,726 --> 00:12:00,291
Please.

218
00:12:20,726 --> 00:12:23,042
Listen, Mr. Braus.
This isn't right.

219
00:12:23,126 --> 00:12:24,775
Please drop the knife.

220
00:12:24,859 --> 00:12:27,642
Or maybe just set it down.

221
00:12:27,726 --> 00:12:30,442
I raised Sasha to be self-sufficient.

222
00:12:30,526 --> 00:12:31,842
Uh. What?

223
00:12:31,926 --> 00:12:34,442
I taught her how to use a bow
when she was young,

224
00:12:34,526 --> 00:12:35,842
and before long, she got good enough

225
00:12:35,926 --> 00:12:37,575
to hunt for food in our forest.

226
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:41,376
It was our way of life, and we
didn't ever wanna give it up.

227
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,976
But after Maria fell, I knew we'd have to

228
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:47,042
change with the times
or die with the old ways,

229
00:12:47,126 --> 00:12:50,442
so I sent Sasha to join civilization.

230
00:12:50,525 --> 00:12:53,442
Then, the world just kept gettin' bigger.

231
00:12:53,525 --> 00:12:56,042
Sasha left our forest
and our island behind,

232
00:12:56,126 --> 00:12:57,909
to fight some distant enemy.

233
00:12:57,993 --> 00:13:00,642
To shoot folks and get shot.

234
00:13:00,726 --> 00:13:04,442
Thing is. She left our forest,

235
00:13:04,525 --> 00:13:06,909
but it turns out she just
traded it for a bigger one,

236
00:13:06,993 --> 00:13:10,575
where the same rule of "kill
or be killed" still applied.

237
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:12,909
I reckon Sasha died

238
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:16,442
'cause she wandered in
that forest for too long.

239
00:13:16,525 --> 00:13:19,042
We've gotta get the children
outta that forest

240
00:13:19,126 --> 00:13:20,976
at the very least.

241
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,976
Or else there's nothing gonna stop this

242
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:26,776
from happenin' again and again.

243
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:28,109
Way I see it,

244
00:13:28,193 --> 00:13:31,042
when it comes to shouldering the
sins and hatreds of the past,

245
00:13:31,126 --> 00:13:34,642
that burden should fall to
adults like you and me.

246
00:13:34,726 --> 00:13:37,857
Please, Nicolo. We need
you to let Ben go now.

247
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:48,842
Good. Okay.
Slow and steady does it, Lisa.

248
00:13:48,926 --> 00:13:49,976
Right.

249
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,642
Show me your wounds.

250
00:13:51,726 --> 00:13:55,575
Mia. You're okay, aren't you?

251
00:13:55,659 --> 00:13:58,442
I-I don't understand.

252
00:13:58,525 --> 00:14:00,757
Do you really not hate me?

253
00:14:10,859 --> 00:14:11,976
Kaya...

254
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:16,430
{\an8} Kaya stop, calm down, please.  

255
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:14,976
Murderer! You killed my sister!
How dare you say my name!

256
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,575
I thought you were
my friend! How could you?!

257
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:19,590
I think we should go. Come on.

258
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:37,291
The main dish must've gone cold by now.

259
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:43,842
Hange. You should rinse out
that kid's mouth out with water.

260
00:14:43,926 --> 00:14:45,642
Some of the wine got into it.

261
00:14:45,726 --> 00:14:46,976
Huh?

262
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,842
Although...
It's probably too late.

263
00:14:49,926 --> 00:14:52,709
Why do you say that?

264
00:14:52,793 --> 00:14:54,857
What's in the wine?

265
00:14:55,459 --> 00:14:59,557
I think... it's
Zeke's spinal fluid.

266
00:15:09,592 --> 00:15:12,042
Zachary was assassinated?

267
00:15:12,126 --> 00:15:14,576
That's correct.
The Jaegerists effectively

268
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:18,043
control everything inside the walls now.

269
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:19,309
We believe that all this chaos

270
00:15:19,392 --> 00:15:22,109
is being caused by Zeke,
through a plan that he's been

271
00:15:22,193 --> 00:15:25,508
using Eren and Yelena to implement.

272
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:26,576
What now?

273
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,109
Not sure, but the way
the winds are blowing right now,

274
00:15:29,193 --> 00:15:30,976
I think Eren will be
brought to Zeke soon,

275
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,043
just as the Jaegerists
have been demanding.

276
00:15:33,127 --> 00:15:36,442
What about Pyxis?
He's just rolling over?

277
00:15:36,526 --> 00:15:37,576
He remains steadfast.

278
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:41,642
He plans to make his move
while Eren's being led here.

279
00:15:41,726 --> 00:15:45,043
And this plan involves
having somebody eat Eren, right?

280
00:15:45,127 --> 00:15:48,109
We're gonna kill him ourselves.

281
00:15:48,193 --> 00:15:49,642
That's right.

281
00:15:49,726 --> 00:15:50,690
Tch.

282
00:15:51,926 --> 00:15:54,842
I've saved Eren, again and again,

283
00:15:54,926 --> 00:15:58,109
watching more of my
comrades die every time.

284
00:15:58,193 --> 00:16:00,442
I did that because I believed

285
00:16:00,526 --> 00:16:03,442
he was the best hope humanity had.

286
00:16:03,526 --> 00:16:04,909
And this.

287
00:16:04,993 --> 00:16:07,576
This is where that belief has gotten me.

288
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,708
It's like I'm at the punchline
of some awful joke.

289
00:16:10,792 --> 00:16:13,690
What the hell became of
the hope we all looked towards?

290
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:18,909
All that struggle.
All that death.

291
00:16:18,993 --> 00:16:20,723
For this farce.

292
00:16:21,326 --> 00:16:24,642
Such bullshit.
It's not even funny.

293
00:16:24,726 --> 00:16:26,508
The piece of shit
we need to feed to a Titan

294
00:16:26,592 --> 00:16:27,857
is right beneath us.

295
00:16:30,526 --> 00:16:31,709
What did you just say?

296
00:16:31,793 --> 00:16:34,909
Why the hell would Zeke Jaeger's
spinal fluid be in the wine?

297
00:16:34,993 --> 00:16:38,709
I don't actually
have proof. But still.

298
00:16:38,793 --> 00:16:42,109
They packed the first survey
fleet to the brim with it.

299
00:16:42,193 --> 00:16:43,109
There's no way they'd've needed

300
00:16:43,193 --> 00:16:46,257
that much alcohol for a scouting mission.

301
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:48,243
Again.

302
00:16:48,326 --> 00:16:50,709
And. Just as I was
starting to settle into

303
00:16:50,793 --> 00:16:53,909
my new job here as a chef,
I received instructions.

304
00:16:53,993 --> 00:16:56,709
In short, I was ordered to start
serving that Marleyan wine

305
00:16:56,793 --> 00:16:58,909
to high-ranking military officers.

306
00:16:58,993 --> 00:17:00,590
Who ordered it?

307
00:17:02,526 --> 00:17:04,709
It was Yelena.

308
00:17:04,793 --> 00:17:08,576
As far as I know, she's the
only one who was in on it.

309
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,842
I can't speak for the other volunteers.

310
00:17:11,926 --> 00:17:14,709
No. I... I didn't know
about any of this.

311
00:17:14,793 --> 00:17:16,109
I give you my word.

312
00:17:16,193 --> 00:17:17,976
This doesn't make sense though!

313
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:20,709
When Zeke's spinal fluid
is ingested by an Eldian,

314
00:17:20,793 --> 00:17:21,909
they're supposed to freeze up.

315
00:17:21,993 --> 00:17:24,043
That's only what we were told by Zeke.

316
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:26,709
None of us have ever seen
how it happens in person.

317
00:17:26,793 --> 00:17:28,508
And there was no proof.

318
00:17:28,592 --> 00:17:29,842
But we bought it.

319
00:17:29,926 --> 00:17:34,308
It seems like such a small lie,
but it's had an enormous effect.

320
00:17:34,392 --> 00:17:37,308
We thought Zeke's spinal
fluid caused paralysis,

321
00:17:37,392 --> 00:17:38,976
so when the wine caused no symptoms,

322
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,909
we assumed it was safe.

323
00:17:40,993 --> 00:17:43,642
Yeah, but wait. Nicolo.

324
00:17:43,726 --> 00:17:45,909
You don't actually know
that it's dosed, right?

325
00:17:45,993 --> 00:17:48,376
No. Not for a fact.

326
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:51,508
That said, I do know that in the past,

327
00:17:51,592 --> 00:17:53,709
Zeke's spinal fluid has been
used in similar ways,

328
00:17:53,793 --> 00:17:55,657
to tremendous effect.

329
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,776
Ten years ago, Marley conquered

330
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,709
a hostile nation's capital overnight.

331
00:18:01,793 --> 00:18:03,576
This was made possible
by the sudden appearance

332
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:06,909
of hundreds of Titans in the city.

333
00:18:06,993 --> 00:18:09,509
She must plan to use the same trick here.

334
00:18:09,593 --> 00:18:11,109
Why else would she
order me to make sure that

335
00:18:11,192 --> 00:18:14,576
your military's top officers
drank that suspicious wine?

336
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,909
No other explanation makes sense.

337
00:18:16,993 --> 00:18:19,043
If that's true, then when you snatched

338
00:18:19,127 --> 00:18:22,909
that bottle from me earlier,
you were trying to protect us.

339
00:18:22,993 --> 00:18:27,457
No. I have no idea
what I'm doing.

340
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:29,709
I came here to help save the world

341
00:18:29,793 --> 00:18:32,308
from the devils on this island.

342
00:18:32,392 --> 00:18:33,709
Now that I've told you all of this,

343
00:18:33,793 --> 00:18:36,909
I'm sure that my days must be numbered.

344
00:18:36,993 --> 00:18:39,509
Sorry, Mr. Braus.

345
00:18:39,593 --> 00:18:42,308
I can't be as forgiving as you are,

346
00:18:42,392 --> 00:18:45,909
but I do want to atone in some small way.

347
00:18:45,993 --> 00:18:48,709
I was about to murder a child.

348
00:18:48,793 --> 00:18:50,376
How screwed up can I be?

349
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:53,590
I... I just... I...

350
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:56,690
Oh, Nicolo.

351
00:19:00,592 --> 00:19:03,709
Tell me. Why did you save me?

352
00:19:03,793 --> 00:19:07,508
Don't know. Guess I really
didn't have a reason.

353
00:19:07,592 --> 00:19:11,109
I'm the one who killed
your comrades on that airship.

354
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:14,909
I'm the one who crushed that
guard's skull with a brick.

355
00:19:14,993 --> 00:19:17,043
Falco didn't do anything.

356
00:19:17,126 --> 00:19:20,509
So kill me, not him. Okay?

357
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:22,376
We won't kill you.

358
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:25,109
Why not?
I know you must want to.

359
00:19:25,192 --> 00:19:28,442
Why would I want that?

360
00:19:28,526 --> 00:19:29,709
Always with the killing.

361
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,909
It's like it's all you ever think about.

362
00:19:31,993 --> 00:19:34,557
Just like someone else I know.

363
00:19:37,526 --> 00:19:38,557
Er...

364
00:19:42,993 --> 00:19:44,576
Is something wrong?

365
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,909
There you are, Commander.

366
00:19:45,993 --> 00:19:47,709
What's going on?

367
00:19:47,793 --> 00:19:50,108
I'm glad you showed up.

368
00:19:50,192 --> 00:19:52,709
If anyone knows where
Zeke's being held, it's you.

369
00:19:52,793 --> 00:19:54,043
You'll have to drop
whatever it is you're doing

370
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,108
and take us to him.

371
00:19:55,192 --> 00:19:57,509
Wait. We have no intention
of fighting you.

372
00:19:57,593 --> 00:19:59,509
Didn't you get the military's proposal?

373
00:19:59,593 --> 00:20:02,108
We did, and we promptly rejected it.

374
00:20:02,192 --> 00:20:04,509
We refuse to negotiate
with your military.

375
00:20:04,593 --> 00:20:08,108
I see. And why is that?

376
00:20:08,192 --> 00:20:10,376
The decision came from Eren.

377
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,509
He knew that Commander
Pyxis would never leave

378
00:20:12,593 --> 00:20:15,909
the fate of the island
in our hands willingly.

379
00:20:15,993 --> 00:20:17,709
And I agree.

380
00:20:17,793 --> 00:20:19,909
I'm sure that Pyxis is
frantically devising a plan

381
00:20:19,993 --> 00:20:23,509
to ambush Eren and steal the
Founder, even as we speak.

382
00:20:23,593 --> 00:20:25,709
You have quite the imagination.

383
00:20:25,793 --> 00:20:27,509
Or did this come from one of your sources

384
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:28,976
in the Garrison Regiment?

385
00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:31,509
You have comrades
undercover there, don't you?

386
00:20:31,593 --> 00:20:33,509
Do I look like one of your eager lackeys

387
00:20:33,593 --> 00:20:35,709
who's gonna answer
any question that you ask?

388
00:20:35,793 --> 00:20:36,776
Get moving.

389
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,442
I'm willing to prove that
I don't answer to you,

390
00:20:38,526 --> 00:20:40,042
if it comes down to it,

391
00:20:40,126 --> 00:20:42,843
but I'm hoping that you'll
just come along quietly.

392
00:20:42,927 --> 00:20:43,909
Damn it.

393
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,909
How the hell did they know
to look for us here?

394
00:20:45,993 --> 00:20:48,108
Greiz?

395
00:20:48,192 --> 00:20:49,642
Don't tell me you brought them.

396
00:20:49,726 --> 00:20:51,709
Did Yelena put you up to this?

397
00:20:51,793 --> 00:20:52,909
Nicolo.

398
00:20:52,993 --> 00:20:55,909
You've become far too attached
to this group of Eldians.

399
00:20:55,993 --> 00:20:58,909
I knew that you and I would
stand opposed eventually.

400
00:20:58,993 --> 00:21:00,509
I was right not to tell you how to

401
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,643
contact the Scouts when you asked.

402
00:21:02,727 --> 00:21:06,308
Floch, listen!
We can't afford to waste time

403
00:21:06,392 --> 00:21:08,108
fighting amongst ourselves right now!

404
00:21:08,192 --> 00:21:10,108
Wine that's been tainted
with Zeke's spinal fluid

405
00:21:10,192 --> 00:21:12,509
has been disseminated
throughout the military!

406
00:21:12,593 --> 00:21:15,042
Zeke has us dancing
in the palm of his hand!

407
00:21:15,126 --> 00:21:16,308
We have to stop him!

408
00:21:16,392 --> 00:21:17,642
Actually, we don't.

409
00:21:17,726 --> 00:21:22,576
Sounds like those idiot MPs are
gonna become even bigger idiots.

410
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,843
Now let's get moving.

411
00:21:23,927 --> 00:21:28,509
I never said that the MPs drank it.

412
00:21:28,593 --> 00:21:30,309
You're kidding. You knew?

413
00:21:30,393 --> 00:21:32,857
You let them drink that poison?

414
00:21:36,192 --> 00:21:39,590
Keep it down, will ya?
This is a family restaurant.

415
00:21:45,192 --> 00:21:46,509
We're gonna go on ahead.

416
00:21:46,593 --> 00:21:47,975
Good.

417
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:49,709
That was Floch.

418
00:21:49,793 --> 00:21:51,857
So you brought him here with you, then?

419
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,324
Yeah.

420
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:07,023
I wanted to talk with you two.

421
00:23:41,438 --> 00:23:43,220
As his supporters take Hange

422
00:23:43,304 --> 00:23:44,621
and the others captive,

423
00:23:44,704 --> 00:23:48,686
Eren stares intensely
at Armin and Mikasa.

424
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,686
He wants to talk.

425
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:54,768
Next episode: "Savagery."
