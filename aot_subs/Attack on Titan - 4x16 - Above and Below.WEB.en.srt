1
00:00:08,238 --> 00:00:10,354
Wh-What the...?

2
00:00:10,438 --> 00:00:11,554
What was that?

3
00:00:11,638 --> 00:00:13,169
Thunder maybe?

4
00:00:15,305 --> 00:00:17,202
A Thunder Spear.

5
00:00:18,305 --> 00:00:19,636
But why?

6
00:00:24,171 --> 00:00:26,002
Let's head in that direction.

7
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:50,069
It's... It's so quiet.

8
00:00:51,838 --> 00:00:55,302
Am I dying?

9
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:12,427
"The day will soon come when we sit at

10
00:03:12,511 --> 00:03:15,160
the same table once again."

11
00:03:15,244 --> 00:03:17,893
Has it not happened
exactly as I said it would?

12
00:03:17,976 --> 00:03:20,493
Commander Pyxis?

13
00:03:20,577 --> 00:03:23,293
Please let me thank you
for taking such swift action.

14
00:03:23,377 --> 00:03:25,827
Not only have you forbidden
your troops from resisting us,

15
00:03:25,911 --> 00:03:27,627
but in accordance with our demands,

16
00:03:27,711 --> 00:03:29,293
you've also assembled every soldier

17
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:31,693
you have right here in Shiganshina.

18
00:03:31,777 --> 00:03:34,227
Considering the trick you pulled
with the spinal fluid,

19
00:03:34,311 --> 00:03:36,493
we didn't have much of a choice.

20
00:03:36,577 --> 00:03:38,893
Zeke could turn us into
Titans at any moment.

21
00:03:38,976 --> 00:03:40,693
And Shiganshina's been evacuated,

22
00:03:40,777 --> 00:03:43,893
so it's the only safe place for us to be.

23
00:03:43,976 --> 00:03:46,560
In any case.
What else could I do,

24
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:51,160
with so many old comrades
pointing guns at my back?

25
00:03:51,244 --> 00:03:53,293
Please forgive me, Commander Pyxis.

26
00:03:53,377 --> 00:03:56,675
My son drank the wine, too.
I'm doing this to protect him.

27
00:03:57,645 --> 00:03:59,360
When did you first betray us?

28
00:03:59,444 --> 00:04:02,693
You've no obligation to answer that.

29
00:04:02,777 --> 00:04:04,693
I'm sorry.

30
00:04:04,777 --> 00:04:07,427
I only ask because the time
at which you changed sides

31
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:10,892
seems to affect your
standing in this new regime.

32
00:04:10,976 --> 00:04:14,293
Betray us early and you're
rewarded with a white armband.

33
00:04:14,377 --> 00:04:17,226
It marks you as a proud
Jaegerist, correct?

34
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,293
Red armbands are used to
mark those who were

35
00:04:19,377 --> 00:04:21,693
coerced into aiding the Jaegerists,

36
00:04:21,777 --> 00:04:24,892
after learning they
had drunk tainted wine.

37
00:04:24,976 --> 00:04:26,026
And finally.

38
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,293
These black armbands mark the
rest of us as ignorant fools

39
00:04:29,377 --> 00:04:32,892
who drank the wine without
suspecting something was amiss.

40
00:04:32,976 --> 00:04:36,160
I can't help but be reminded of Marley.

41
00:04:36,244 --> 00:04:37,893
They employed a similar system when they

42
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:41,892
took over your homelands, did they not?

43
00:04:41,976 --> 00:04:44,561
There's much to be
learned from our enemies.

44
00:04:44,645 --> 00:04:47,160
Including how to make more, I see.

45
00:04:47,244 --> 00:04:49,360
We offered to stand beside you as allies,

46
00:04:49,444 --> 00:04:51,892
and you responded by
having us imprisoned.

47
00:04:51,976 --> 00:04:53,892
That may be, but since it turns out that

48
00:04:53,976 --> 00:04:55,561
the guests we refused to trust

49
00:04:55,645 --> 00:04:57,893
were serving us tainted wine all along,

50
00:04:57,977 --> 00:05:02,427
I don't know if moving against
you was foolish or wise.

51
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:05,693
Your actions were both foolish and wise.

52
00:05:05,777 --> 00:05:07,561
I'd imagine that if you'd put your faith

53
00:05:07,645 --> 00:05:09,561
in us and Zeke from the start,

54
00:05:09,645 --> 00:05:11,892
the world could've already
been saved by now.

55
00:05:11,976 --> 00:05:13,341
Hm?

56
00:05:15,444 --> 00:05:18,227
You say that "the world"
could've been saved?

57
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:19,893
I was under the impression your plan was

58
00:05:19,977 --> 00:05:22,493
to unite Zeke and Eren
so that they can trigger

59
00:05:22,577 --> 00:05:25,893
a small-scale Rumbling
in order to deter the nations

60
00:05:25,977 --> 00:05:29,826
of the world from attacking us
for the next 50 years or so.

61
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:33,241
But that plan would only
save this island, right?

62
00:05:36,244 --> 00:05:37,293
Uh, Yelena?

63
00:05:37,377 --> 00:05:38,893
It's too late at this point.

64
00:05:38,977 --> 00:05:41,742
Zeke gave you all the time
you should've needed.

65
00:05:42,645 --> 00:05:44,693
And what did you do with that time?

66
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:47,761
You plotted to repay
his mercy by killing him.

67
00:05:47,844 --> 00:05:50,693
Zeke is the god who is
fated to save this world.

68
00:05:50,777 --> 00:05:53,275
And you have invited his wrath.

69
00:05:55,444 --> 00:05:57,627
So what?
Is there nothing we can do

70
00:05:57,711 --> 00:06:00,475
but sit here and wait
for things to play out?

71
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:03,493
Here. You like tea?

72
00:06:03,577 --> 00:06:04,693
Yeah, thanks.

73
00:06:04,776 --> 00:06:05,893
Hey, Armin.

74
00:06:05,977 --> 00:06:09,141
Do you think you could bust us
out of here by turning Titan?

75
00:06:10,776 --> 00:06:14,493
'Fraid not. I'd blow up
half the town if I tried.

76
00:06:14,577 --> 00:06:18,693
The Colossal Titan is powerful,
but it's far from precise.

77
00:06:18,776 --> 00:06:20,675
Unlike Eren's Titan.

78
00:06:23,445 --> 00:06:28,160
So. How did Eren end up
beating you to a pulp, Armin?

79
00:06:28,244 --> 00:06:30,475
I think it's about time you told us.

80
00:06:32,645 --> 00:06:35,427
Eren was hurting Mikasa with his words.

81
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:39,493
So I hit him and he responded in kind.

82
00:06:39,577 --> 00:06:40,627
Huh?

83
00:06:40,711 --> 00:06:43,493
Wait, what do you mean, "he was
hurting her"? What'd he say?

84
00:06:43,577 --> 00:06:45,826
- -Well he...
- -Stop.

85
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,293
It's fine.

86
00:06:47,377 --> 00:06:49,160
No. It isn't fine.

87
00:06:49,244 --> 00:06:51,360
Seriously, tell me what he said to you.

88
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,627
May as well just let it go, Jean.

89
00:06:53,711 --> 00:06:57,561
We already knew that he'd turned
into an absolute piece of shit.

90
00:06:57,645 --> 00:07:00,293
But now he's lost his mind so completely,

91
00:07:00,377 --> 00:07:01,561
that he went out of his way to hurt

92
00:07:01,645 --> 00:07:04,293
the two people he used
to care about most.

93
00:07:04,377 --> 00:07:07,293
Assuming he hasn't just lost it,
I don't see him doing that

94
00:07:07,377 --> 00:07:09,627
without having some kind of reason.

95
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,427
I wonder.

96
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:13,559
Could he have some sort of hidden motive?

97
00:07:15,776 --> 00:07:17,893
Heroes of Shiganshina.

98
00:07:17,977 --> 00:07:20,627
It's always an honor to see you.

99
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,627
It pains me that our reunion

100
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,293
must take place across these bars.

101
00:07:25,377 --> 00:07:29,692
No way. You're on their
side, too? Let us out!

102
00:07:29,776 --> 00:07:32,493
Seems like more than you
have the right to ask for,

103
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:35,693
considering how you guys
kept me as a prisoner.

104
00:07:35,777 --> 00:07:37,826
Just sit here and wait.

105
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:40,427
Zeke and Eren will meet soon.

106
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:41,693
Why, you.

107
00:07:41,777 --> 00:07:44,293
You must be proud, Yelena.

108
00:07:44,377 --> 00:07:45,561
It seems like everything's happening

109
00:07:45,645 --> 00:07:47,692
exactly as you planned.

110
00:07:47,776 --> 00:07:51,293
First, you get Eren
dancing to Zeke's tune.

111
00:07:51,377 --> 00:07:52,893
Then, the raid on Marley

112
00:07:52,977 --> 00:07:55,227
won you the Eldian people's support.

113
00:07:55,311 --> 00:07:57,427
Which gave you free reign
to use your poisoned wine

114
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:59,493
to take over the military.

115
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:02,627
Eldia's yours.
As is the Founding Titan.

116
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:06,692
Now, you can crush Marley
and avenge your homelands.

117
00:08:06,776 --> 00:08:07,893
That's it, right?

118
00:08:07,977 --> 00:08:10,893
The real reason that you
volunteers came to this island?

119
00:08:10,977 --> 00:08:13,160
We brought your country out of the past.

120
00:08:13,244 --> 00:08:15,693
When we got here, this island
was downright primitive.

121
00:08:15,777 --> 00:08:16,960
Huh?

122
00:08:17,044 --> 00:08:19,826
But you were really just setting
it up for yourselves, right?

123
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,493
Making sure the place was worth ruling.

124
00:08:22,577 --> 00:08:24,493
You were played for fools and defeated.

125
00:08:24,577 --> 00:08:26,293
What else is there to be said?

126
00:08:26,377 --> 00:08:29,493
Hey, Griez. Did you
seriously betray us

127
00:08:29,577 --> 00:08:32,160
just so that Yelena would
make you one of her lackeys?

128
00:08:32,244 --> 00:08:33,361
You little rat.

129
00:08:33,445 --> 00:08:36,826
Are you stupid? I didn't take
the side of these devils.

130
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:39,693
You did.
You're the real traitor.

131
00:08:39,777 --> 00:08:40,760
Say what?

132
00:08:40,844 --> 00:08:43,493
You fell for some filth-blooded,
potato-grubbing devil,

133
00:08:43,577 --> 00:08:46,493
just because she liked your food.

134
00:08:46,577 --> 00:08:47,493
Get over here. I'll kill you!

135
00:08:47,577 --> 00:08:49,293
Stop, Nicolo! Calm down!

136
00:08:49,377 --> 00:08:50,626
The way you would blather about her

137
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,361
day and night was sickening.

138
00:08:52,445 --> 00:08:54,227
Can't believe I was
stupid enough to think that

139
00:08:54,311 --> 00:08:56,493
you'd get a grip once that bitch died.

140
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,160
What did you just call her?

141
00:08:58,244 --> 00:09:00,293
I'll make it easy to understand.

142
00:09:00,377 --> 00:09:02,741
That spawn-of-the-devil
whore deserved ex...

143
00:09:06,377 --> 00:09:07,893
Yelena?

144
00:09:07,977 --> 00:09:10,693
I apologize for his rudeness.

145
00:09:10,777 --> 00:09:13,427
This island no longer
has any need for those

146
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:15,893
who would curse you as devils.

147
00:09:15,977 --> 00:09:17,826
Please believe me when I tell you

148
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:19,826
that the goal we've been working towards

149
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:23,493
is not so petty or hollow
as taking revenge on Marley.

150
00:09:23,576 --> 00:09:26,361
It is to sever the chains
of hate from this world,

151
00:09:26,445 --> 00:09:30,693
and in doing so, to save
both Eldia and Marley.

152
00:09:30,777 --> 00:09:32,293
We're done with secrets.

153
00:09:32,377 --> 00:09:34,293
It's high-time you learned the truth.

154
00:09:34,377 --> 00:09:36,493
Let me lay out the plan
that will save the world.

155
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,375
Zeke's so-called "euthanization" plan.

156
00:09:43,777 --> 00:09:45,693
They're all vicious devils.

157
00:09:45,777 --> 00:09:49,308
So, why haven't they killed me yet?

158
00:09:52,377 --> 00:09:55,293
Brat who killed Sasha,
you're coming with me.

159
00:09:55,377 --> 00:09:57,493
Huh? What do you want?

160
00:09:57,576 --> 00:10:00,674
If you're hoping to
save Falco, you'll help me.

161
00:10:03,977 --> 00:10:08,293
H-Help you? How?

162
00:10:08,377 --> 00:10:10,693
You'll put out a distress
call on the radio

163
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,508
to lure out any spies
who've infiltrated the walls.

164
00:10:15,777 --> 00:10:19,626
Don't move. Gabi. Stay quiet.

165
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,227
Pieck, you...!

166
00:10:22,311 --> 00:10:23,707
I said quiet.

167
00:10:24,644 --> 00:10:27,361
Now then.
Just to be doubly sure.

168
00:10:27,445 --> 00:10:30,475
It's Eren Jaeger, correct?

169
00:10:38,877 --> 00:10:42,641
Gabi. Take that rifle
and point it at Eren.

170
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,408
Gabi.

171
00:10:51,278 --> 00:10:54,526
Eren. Move your hands
from your pockets.

172
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:56,926
And what'll you do if I don't?

173
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,726
I'll fire this pistol.

174
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:01,260
And then you'll be dead.
Brains on the floor.

175
00:11:01,344 --> 00:11:02,726
Ever seen that?

176
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,726
You won't have time to transform.

177
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,726
Okay. So why
haven't you shot me?

178
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,327
If you aren't here to pull that trigger,

179
00:11:09,411 --> 00:11:11,327
then what did you come here to do?

180
00:11:11,411 --> 00:11:13,726
What'll happen if I keep
my hands in my pockets?

181
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:14,860
Doesn't seem like that's something

182
00:11:14,944 --> 00:11:16,327
you'll ever get to know,

183
00:11:16,411 --> 00:11:17,726
seeing as your brains will be on the fl...

184
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,726
I do know.
You aren't gonna shoot.

185
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,327
Because you weren't given permission

186
00:11:22,411 --> 00:11:24,860
to kill the Founding Titan.

187
00:11:24,944 --> 00:11:28,327
You've been told to
retrieve it, no matter what.

188
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:31,459
But in order to do that, you'd
need to get me to stay still

189
00:11:31,543 --> 00:11:34,459
while you transformed into
a Titan and ate me alive.

190
00:11:34,543 --> 00:11:35,327
That right?

191
00:11:35,411 --> 00:11:36,674
What do I do?

192
00:11:38,477 --> 00:11:39,327
Stand down.

193
00:11:39,411 --> 00:11:41,394
Take your finger off the trigger, Gabi.

194
00:11:41,477 --> 00:11:42,394
Huh?

195
00:11:42,477 --> 00:11:45,127
If you were to defy your
orders by shooting me,

196
00:11:45,211 --> 00:11:47,127
you wouldn't pay the price alone.

197
00:11:47,211 --> 00:11:50,275
Your family in the zone
would pay it with you.

198
00:11:52,477 --> 00:11:54,860
Yeah, you're right.
I won't shoot you.

199
00:11:54,944 --> 00:11:56,460
And it doesn't look like I'm likely to

200
00:11:56,544 --> 00:12:00,194
get a chance to eat you,
either. So that's that.

201
00:12:00,278 --> 00:12:01,926
Seriously?

202
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,327
You found my Titan's footprints

203
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:06,593
from when I first snuck
onto the island, right?

204
00:12:06,677 --> 00:12:08,327
I still think I did all right.

205
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,194
This was a hell of a time
to try and infiltrate

206
00:12:10,278 --> 00:12:13,394
your military without
getting thrown in jail.

207
00:12:13,477 --> 00:12:16,327
But I actually have another
reason not to shoot you.

208
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,926
If you can use the
Founding Titan's power,

209
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:22,242
then you have the strength
to defeat Marley, don't you?

210
00:12:24,278 --> 00:12:26,127
You made the world your enemy.

211
00:12:26,211 --> 00:12:27,593
You wouldn't have
done that unless you knew

212
00:12:27,677 --> 00:12:29,926
you had a chance of winning, right?

213
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,526
What do you know that I don't?

214
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,593
Do you have more than just the Founder?

215
00:12:33,677 --> 00:12:36,327
Hold on, Pieck.
What are you doing?

216
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:39,794
Gabi. You can put
the rifle down now.

217
00:12:39,878 --> 00:12:42,593
Suppose I did.
What is it that you want?

218
00:12:42,677 --> 00:12:44,327
Freedom for all Eldians.

219
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:46,127
And an end to their subjugation by Marley

220
00:12:46,211 --> 00:12:47,860
and the rest of the world.

221
00:12:47,944 --> 00:12:52,726
Also. I want to get my family
out of the internment zone.

222
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:55,327
I became a Warrior to help my father,

223
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57,194
the one person I can call family,

224
00:12:57,278 --> 00:12:59,526
get proper medical care.

225
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,860
He got the treatment
he needed and survived,

226
00:13:01,944 --> 00:13:04,726
but knowing that my term
will be over soon,

227
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,926
he's been inconsolable.

228
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,726
Before I die and leave him on his own,

229
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:13,860
I want to show him that
Eldia has a bright future.

230
00:13:13,944 --> 00:13:15,327
And for that to happen,

231
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,860
Marley's great empire
needs to be crushed.

232
00:13:17,944 --> 00:13:20,460
There's nothing I won't
do toward that end.

233
00:13:20,544 --> 00:13:22,726
So long as we can
slaughter all the Marleyans.

234
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,841
I'll help you however I can.

235
00:13:30,544 --> 00:13:31,860
First I found out that Zeke

236
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:34,526
planned the attack on Liberio.

237
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,260
And now... Now you?

238
00:13:37,343 --> 00:13:40,194
I thought we were trying to show
the world we're good Eldians!

239
00:13:40,278 --> 00:13:42,326
If we just work hard and prove that,

240
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:44,326
then one day, we'll be set free!

241
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:48,261
Tell me. What have we been
fighting for if not that?

242
00:13:48,344 --> 00:13:51,393
You're the same as Zeke...
A worthless traitor!

243
00:13:51,477 --> 00:13:53,526
Let me ask you.

244
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:55,726
What are we?

245
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:58,860
Are we Marleyan? Or Eldian?

246
00:13:58,944 --> 00:14:00,860
Which one comes first?

247
00:14:00,944 --> 00:14:04,260
We're Marleyans first.
Honorary Marleyans.

248
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:08,194
Not so. Above all else,
we're Subjects of Ymir.

249
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:11,460
That's one truth which
we can never escape.

250
00:14:11,544 --> 00:14:13,393
No matter what we call ourselves,

251
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:16,261
we're a people who can
turn or be turned into Titans.

252
00:14:16,344 --> 00:14:18,526
But as both of us saw at Fort Slava.

253
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:21,393
The power of Titans is on
its way out as we speak.

254
00:14:21,477 --> 00:14:22,726
Once it becomes obsolete,

255
00:14:22,810 --> 00:14:24,660
the Marleyans will have no use for us.

256
00:14:24,744 --> 00:14:27,593
They'll slaughter us
without a second thought!

257
00:14:27,677 --> 00:14:28,926
It doesn't matter how hard we work

258
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,860
to try and prove that
we're "good" Eldians.

259
00:14:30,944 --> 00:14:32,393
They will put us down like animals

260
00:14:32,477 --> 00:14:34,326
before they ever set us free.

261
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:36,526
We have to secure our right
to live with our own hands,

262
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,808
even it means getting them dirty.

263
00:14:40,744 --> 00:14:42,260
I need proof.

264
00:14:42,344 --> 00:14:44,926
If you honestly intend
to cooperate with us,

265
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:48,326
then back up your words with action.

266
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,460
I'll show you where to find the soldiers

267
00:14:49,544 --> 00:14:50,726
who snuck into town with me.

268
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:51,660
Wha...?

269
00:14:51,744 --> 00:14:52,726
How exactly?

270
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:55,326
If you take me up to
the roof of this building,

271
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,108
I can point them out for you.

272
00:14:59,344 --> 00:15:01,526
Fine.

273
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,526
They'll change our bodies
so we stop having children?

274
00:15:04,610 --> 00:15:05,594
Correct.

275
00:15:05,678 --> 00:15:08,526
That is the heart of
Zeke's euthanization plan.

276
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,726
Once the Founder's power
has done all its work,

277
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:15,127
all suffering related to Titans
will slowly come to an end.

278
00:15:15,211 --> 00:15:17,726
You'll fade away. Peacefully.

279
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:20,726
Wait. How is that
gonna be peaceful?

280
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:22,393
If the population of Eldians withers

281
00:15:22,477 --> 00:15:23,860
until we've all died out,

282
00:15:23,944 --> 00:15:25,326
then in this country's final years,

283
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,326
it'll be nothing but old geezers.

284
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:29,594
How can we be sure we
won't get massacred then?

285
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,726
You think the world's
just gonna leave us alone?

286
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:34,194
The Rumbling can remain as a deterrent,

287
00:15:34,277 --> 00:15:36,794
as long as your people retain
control of the Founder,

288
00:15:36,878 --> 00:15:40,526
whilst ensuring that the royal
bloodline doesn't die out.

289
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:42,794
Fortunately, it seems Queen Historia

290
00:15:42,878 --> 00:15:45,326
has already been blessed with an heir.

291
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,660
So, assuming her child lives a long life,

292
00:15:47,744 --> 00:15:51,326
you just need to pass on
the Founder every 13 years.

293
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:53,326
You talk as if that's
an absolute certainty,

294
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,726
but it isn't.

295
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:57,460
"Certainties." "Sure things."
They aren't real.

296
00:15:57,544 --> 00:15:59,860
Our world is full of risk and doubt.

297
00:15:59,944 --> 00:16:01,594
There isn't a nation
in it that doesn't have

298
00:16:01,678 --> 00:16:04,127
its share of troubles.

299
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,726
If there's one thing that is certain,

300
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:10,526
it's that this era of tears
and bloodshed is almost over.

301
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:16,526
The age of Titans will soon be
put to an end by Zeke and Eren.

302
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,726
There may be countless millennia

303
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,326
of human history that've yet to pass,

304
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,660
but even given that much time,

305
00:16:21,744 --> 00:16:24,860
will anyone ever
accomplish an equal feat?

306
00:16:24,944 --> 00:16:27,594
The Jaeger Brothers will be spoken of as

307
00:16:27,678 --> 00:16:31,326
legendary symbols for
thousands of years to come.

308
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:34,460
Just as we speak today of ancient gods.

309
00:16:34,544 --> 00:16:35,860
Long after they're dead,

310
00:16:35,944 --> 00:16:37,594
they'll shine in mankind's memory.

311
00:16:37,678 --> 00:16:39,876
They'll be known as
saviors who lit a path...

312
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,460
Is something the matter?

313
00:16:45,544 --> 00:16:49,675
No. But to think that
your cause was so noble.

314
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:55,260
It just touched my heart!

315
00:16:55,344 --> 00:16:58,126
That's wonderful to hear.

316
00:16:58,210 --> 00:17:00,860
I'm so glad that you're
able to understand.

317
00:17:00,944 --> 00:17:02,794
Bad news, Yelena!

318
00:17:02,878 --> 00:17:04,526
We need you to come quick, please!

319
00:17:04,610 --> 00:17:05,609
We're being invaded!

320
00:17:06,277 --> 00:17:07,061
The enemy's arrived!

321
00:17:07,144 --> 00:17:08,260
I hear someone was killed!

322
00:17:08,344 --> 00:17:10,526
Apparently, the Cart Titan is here!

323
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:11,460
Seriously?

324
00:17:11,544 --> 00:17:13,526
Yeah! Did she betray Marley?

325
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:15,526
That's what Jaeger said.

326
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:18,508
That's odd. What's all
the commotion about?

327
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,594
So is it safe to say that you've decided

328
00:17:22,678 --> 00:17:24,927
to let us defect to your side?

329
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:28,526
If you actually give up
the other infiltrators.

330
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:32,393
Until you do, I'm keeping you
cuffed to the kid.

331
00:17:32,477 --> 00:17:37,526
If you try to turn into a Titan,
she'll be burned to ash.

332
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,260
That's understandable.

333
00:17:39,344 --> 00:17:42,274
And don't worry, the kid'll
come around soon enough.

334
00:17:43,878 --> 00:17:46,460
That dainty thing is a Marleyan soldier?

335
00:17:46,544 --> 00:17:47,726
Think we can trust her?

336
00:17:47,810 --> 00:17:49,742
Hello, everyone!

337
00:17:54,344 --> 00:17:58,927
Uh, hey. What did you
do with Falco?

338
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:00,727
He's around here, too.

339
00:18:00,811 --> 00:18:04,541
But it seems he drank
some of Zeke's spinal fluid.

340
00:18:05,811 --> 00:18:07,526
How'd it happen?

341
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:09,126
Who knows?

342
00:18:09,210 --> 00:18:13,260
All I heard was that the dosed
wine got in his mouth somehow.

343
00:18:13,344 --> 00:18:15,326
Did it happen when I...?

344
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,326
What's wrong?

345
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,708
This is completely
my fault. Again.

346
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:24,326
I see now.
You took over the military

347
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:27,326
by way of Zeke's spinal fluid.

348
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:32,126
Do you have any idea why he
possesses such a unique ability?

349
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:36,126
None at all. I don't
suppose you would know.

350
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,260
'Course not.

351
00:18:37,344 --> 00:18:38,794
Only one person knows.

352
00:18:38,878 --> 00:18:40,808
And that's Zeke himself.

353
00:18:42,744 --> 00:18:46,193
Ever since I met him,
it's felt as though every word

354
00:18:46,277 --> 00:18:49,126
that came out of his mouth was a lie.

355
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:52,660
Four years ago, I confirmed that hunch.

356
00:18:52,744 --> 00:18:57,394
When I finally heard him
speak sincerely, to you.

357
00:18:57,478 --> 00:19:00,860
"Believe me, Eren. I get it.
I know how you feel.

358
00:19:00,944 --> 00:19:05,308
Someday, I'll come back
and save you from this."

359
00:19:07,478 --> 00:19:09,526
If he wouldn't lie to you,
then surely he would've

360
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,260
told you the secret of his special power.

361
00:19:12,344 --> 00:19:13,794
At the very least,

362
00:19:13,878 --> 00:19:15,727
I assume he's told you
that it's connected

363
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:18,475
to drawing out the power
of the Founding Titan.

364
00:19:23,878 --> 00:19:24,660
Hey there.

365
00:19:24,744 --> 00:19:27,594
Why'd you go and shave your beard?

366
00:19:27,678 --> 00:19:29,708
I thought it suited you.

367
00:19:33,811 --> 00:19:36,727
Eren. That woman
is exceedingly dangerous.

368
00:19:36,811 --> 00:19:38,727
It isn't safe to trust her.

369
00:19:38,811 --> 00:19:43,274
I know. And I don't trust her
any more than she trusts me.

370
00:19:49,678 --> 00:19:54,394
So. Why haven't you used
the Founder's power yet?

371
00:19:54,478 --> 00:19:55,594
Where's Zeke?

372
00:19:55,678 --> 00:19:58,141
You'll find that out soon enough.

373
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:03,141
Now show me. Where is the enemy?

374
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,675
Right there.

375
00:20:56,678 --> 00:20:58,926
What the hell?

376
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:01,527
I think it's beginning.

377
00:21:01,611 --> 00:21:05,708
The Titans have started to move.

378
00:21:08,877 --> 00:21:11,526
Is that you, Galliard?

379
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,926
Didn't quite get him,
but it was worth a shot.

380
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:16,926
Wait, Pieck! You're not
actually a traitor?

381
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:20,526
Gabi! You really thought
I'd sell out my comrades?

382
00:21:20,610 --> 00:21:23,260
Well, you said if we kept
fighting for Marley,

383
00:21:23,344 --> 00:21:25,792
- -we'd end up getting put down!
- -Look up there.

384
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:32,194
I don't trust Marley one bit.

385
00:21:32,278 --> 00:21:34,527
Having said that, I trust the comrades

386
00:21:34,611 --> 00:21:37,108
who've fought at my side completely.

387
00:21:40,544 --> 00:21:42,260
There's the smoke signal.

388
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:43,727
Pieck and Galliard tracked him down

389
00:21:43,811 --> 00:21:46,727
and forced him out into the open.

390
00:21:46,811 --> 00:21:49,108
The Founder is here.

391
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:53,860
Let's pay him back for Liberio!

392
00:21:53,944 --> 00:21:56,608
I want that bastard dead!

393
00:22:00,678 --> 00:22:02,375
Bring it on, then.

394
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:06,841
Reiner!

9999
