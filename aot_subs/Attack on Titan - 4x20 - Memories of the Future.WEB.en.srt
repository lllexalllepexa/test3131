3
00:00:34,576 --> 00:00:37,746
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}This must be one of
our Dad's memories.

4
00:00:37,826 --> 00:00:40,586
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}He looked every bit
as innocent as you did.

5
00:00:40,666 --> 00:00:42,086
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}Happy, too.

6
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:44,586
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}The man pushed his friends

00:00:44,666 --> 00:00:47,876
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}yet there's no trace

00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:49,886
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}Why are you showing me this?

9
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,506
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}So you'll understand who he was.

10
00:00:52,596 --> 00:00:56,226
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}He sacrificed his children
on the altar of nationalism

11
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:59,646
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}and brainwashed us both
in the name of Eldia.

12
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:03,026
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}Just wait. Soon, you'll see.

13
00:01:12,986 --> 00:01:15,366
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}Guess you pulled it off, Grisha.

14
00:01:15,446 --> 00:01:18,536
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}You built a new life somewhere
so far from your old one

15
00:01:18,616 --> 00:01:21,206
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}that you could leave
your mistakes behind.

16
00:01:21,286 --> 00:01:23,706
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}No one blames you here.

17
00:01:23,786 --> 00:01:26,916
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}Not for what you did
to your first family.

18
00:01:27,006 --> 00:01:29,506
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}Nor for the way you forgot us.

19
00:01:31,756 --> 00:01:33,216
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}[ZEKE]
Let's go.

20
00:01:50,146 --> 00:01:51,566
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}[ZEKE]
Next.

21
00:01:55,026 --> 00:01:56,536
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}Look at this, Eren.

22
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,156
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}That's the real Grisha Jaeger.

23
00:01:59,246 --> 00:02:01,116
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}He used his job as
a doctor to get close

24
00:02:01,206 --> 00:02:04,206
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}to powerful people
within the walls.

25
00:02:04,286 --> 00:02:06,416
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}That was how he
hunted down the King.

26
00:02:06,506 --> 00:02:09,916
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}He was after the Founder
the whole time.

27
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:12,296
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}He knew that
if he ever got caught,

28
00:02:12,386 --> 00:02:15,386
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}his wife and son would
pay the price with him.

29
00:02:15,466 --> 00:02:17,386
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}But he kept doing it anyway.

30
00:02:17,466 --> 00:02:19,176
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}And do you know why?

31
00:02:20,176 --> 00:02:23,686
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}'Cause he'd gladly drag his
family through shit for Eldia.

32
00:02:23,766 --> 00:02:24,896
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}He was a shitty human being

33
00:02:24,976 --> 00:02:27,856
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}who did a shitty job
as a father.

34
00:02:27,936 --> 00:02:30,146
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}I understand now.

35
00:02:30,236 --> 00:02:32,856
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}You've undone his brainwashing.

36
00:02:32,946 --> 00:02:35,986
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}I should've just not been born.

37
00:02:36,076 --> 00:02:38,236
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}Thanks for showing me the light.

38
00:02:41,326 --> 00:02:43,456
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}[ZEKE] We have
all the time in the world.

39
00:02:43,536 --> 00:02:45,376
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}No need to rush.

40
00:03:12,856 --> 00:03:14,526
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}Here already?

41
00:03:14,606 --> 00:03:17,616
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}Can't believe he found it
in so little time.

42
00:03:17,696 --> 00:03:20,286
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}You know this place?

43
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:23,116
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}The King of the walls
hid out here.

44
00:03:23,206 --> 00:03:25,416
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}[ZEKE]
That doesn't make sense.

45
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,666
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}Grisha stole the Founder
when the walls fell.

46
00:03:27,746 --> 00:03:30,756
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}And that won't happen
for a number of years.

47
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:33,296
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}Why did he wait so long?

48
00:04:09,746 --> 00:04:11,496
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}[ZEKE]
I see.

49
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:14,756
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}He delayed his mission
for the sake of his son.

50
00:04:14,836 --> 00:04:17,836
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}He set aside his cause
for his family.

51
00:04:19,806 --> 00:04:22,556
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}Would've been nice if he
could have done that for me.

52
00:04:22,636 --> 00:04:23,886
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}Good for you, though.

53
00:04:23,976 --> 00:04:26,596
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}I guess losing his first
family taught him to care.

54
00:04:26,686 --> 00:04:29,226
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}But even so,
he passed you his banner

55
00:04:29,306 --> 00:04:32,226
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}and set you marching
down his path.

56
00:04:32,316 --> 00:04:35,236
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}You'll never be the person
you could've been.

57
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:37,906
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}You'll understand that in time.

58
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:46,456
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}[GRISHA]
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:47,326 --> 00:04:49,326
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}Please, Zeke. Forgive me.

Zeke?

64
00:04:59,336 --> 00:05:01,676
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}Zeke, is that actually you?

65
00:05:15,276 --> 00:05:17,356
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}[GRISHA]
Don't be stupid.

66
00:05:17,446 --> 00:05:21,986
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}Even if Zeke could get here,
he wouldn't be old and bearded.

67
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:23,776
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}You're dreaming.

68
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:26,496
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}What is this?

69
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:30,786
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}[EREN]
Next. We're finished here.

70
00:05:30,876 --> 00:05:32,336
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}Right?

72
00:07:09,926 --> 00:07:12,516
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}[ZEKE] At this point,
you're nine years old.

73
00:07:14,056 --> 00:07:18,856
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}Grisha truly cared for you.
He let you grow up normally.

74
00:07:18,936 --> 00:07:22,856
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}He never recruited you into
the Eldian Restoration movement.

75
00:07:22,946 --> 00:07:25,406
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}I said you were
wasting your breath.

76
00:07:25,496 --> 00:07:26,656
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}We've been wandering
through years

77
00:07:26,736 --> 00:07:29,036
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}of his memories for nothing.

00:07:34,956 --> 00:07:37,286
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}He forced you to

82
00:07:39,586 --> 00:07:43,426
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}So what was it that made you

83
00:07:45,586 --> 00:07:49,716
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}Eren. Why not bring an end

84
00:07:49,806 --> 00:07:53,976
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}And if peace wasn't your goal,

85
00:07:55,846 --> 00:08:00,436
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}[EREN] Because.
Since the day I was born...

00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,606
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}[EREN]
...this is who I've been.

87
00:08:09,486 --> 00:08:11,116
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}[EREN] When you learned
you had a brother,

00:08:26,546 --> 00:08:29,426
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}It wasn't because of

95
00:08:32,676 --> 00:08:35,096
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd" size="55">{\an20}Since the day you were born.

96

108
00:09:08,176 --> 00:09:12,096
