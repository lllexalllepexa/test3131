1
00:00:02,122 --> 00:00:05,438
Tell me. Why did you save me?

2
00:00:05,522 --> 00:00:09,371
Don't know. Guess I really
didn't have a reason.

3
00:00:09,455 --> 00:00:12,972
I'm the one who killed
your comrades on that airship.

4
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:16,906
I'm the one who crushed that
guard's skull with a brick.

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:22,106
Falco didn't do anything.
So kill me, not him. Okay?

6
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,038
We won't kill you.

7
00:00:24,122 --> 00:00:26,838
Why not?
I know you must want to.

8
00:00:26,922 --> 00:00:30,038
Why would I want that?

9
00:00:30,122 --> 00:00:31,438
Always with the killing.

10
00:00:31,522 --> 00:00:33,638
It's like it's all you ever think about.

11
00:00:33,722 --> 00:00:36,020
Just like someone else I know.

12
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:40,053
Er...

13
00:02:27,496 --> 00:02:30,278
I just wanna talk to you.

14
00:02:30,362 --> 00:02:34,612
More conflict isn't necessary
to solve Eldia's problems.

15
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:39,278
Hange and the others are fine.
We're just relocating them.

16
00:02:39,362 --> 00:02:44,412
Eren, Mikasa and I have been
wanting to talk to you, too.

17
00:02:44,496 --> 00:02:46,011
What were you thinking when you decided

18
00:02:46,095 --> 00:02:48,345
to attack Marley on your own?

19
00:02:48,429 --> 00:02:50,212
Why do all this?

20
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:53,493
Did Zeke and Yelena really
win you over to their side?

21
00:03:01,296 --> 00:03:04,078
I am free, Armin.

22
00:03:04,162 --> 00:03:07,478
Every single thing that
I've done, I decided to do.

23
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:11,427
My actions are governed by
nothing but my own free will.

24
00:03:12,296 --> 00:03:15,012
So even though you
secretly met with Yelena,

25
00:03:15,096 --> 00:03:17,278
you're saying that this was all you?

26
00:03:17,362 --> 00:03:18,078
Yes.

27
00:03:18,162 --> 00:03:21,012
No way. You're being
manipulated!

28
00:03:21,096 --> 00:03:23,212
The Eren I know would never involve

29
00:03:23,296 --> 00:03:26,612
civilians and children in a war,
even if they were enemies.

30
00:03:26,696 --> 00:03:29,011
And you wouldn't put us at risk either.

31
00:03:29,095 --> 00:03:32,412
You care about us more than anyone.

32
00:03:32,496 --> 00:03:33,478
Don't you?

33
00:03:33,562 --> 00:03:36,278
You rescued me from those
kidnappers in the cabin

34
00:03:36,362 --> 00:03:38,212
and wrapped this scarf around me,

35
00:03:38,296 --> 00:03:39,345
because you're a kind person!

36
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:42,959
I said to keep your hands
on the table, Mikasa.

37
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:51,011
Back in Liberio, I spoke with Zeke,

38
00:03:51,095 --> 00:03:52,078
brother to brother.

39
00:03:52,162 --> 00:03:54,612
Learned a lot of things from him.

40
00:03:54,695 --> 00:03:57,078
Honestly, it seems like
he knows even more

41
00:03:57,162 --> 00:04:00,745
about how Titans work than Marley does.

42
00:04:00,829 --> 00:04:03,478
Armin, What do you think it is

43
00:04:03,562 --> 00:04:06,278
that drove you to start visiting Annie?

44
00:04:06,362 --> 00:04:08,412
Do you really believe
it's your own free will?

45
00:04:08,496 --> 00:04:11,012
Huh? What? I don't...

46
00:04:11,096 --> 00:04:13,478
If memories play
a major role in shaping us

47
00:04:13,562 --> 00:04:15,278
into the people we are,

48
00:04:15,362 --> 00:04:18,278
then part of you has become Bertholdt.

49
00:04:18,362 --> 00:04:23,278
Within you is an enemy who has
feelings for another enemy.

50
00:04:23,362 --> 00:04:25,012
Understand?

51
00:04:25,096 --> 00:04:28,011
Bertholdt has gotten into your head.

52
00:04:28,095 --> 00:04:31,560
You're the one being
manipulated by the enemy.

53
00:04:33,362 --> 00:04:34,278
Hey! Why would you...?

54
00:04:34,362 --> 00:04:35,810
You're being controlled, too.

55
00:04:37,296 --> 00:04:39,677
The Ackermann clan was
designed to be perfect

56
00:04:39,761 --> 00:04:43,278
for the task of protecting Eldia's king.

57
00:04:43,362 --> 00:04:45,612
Your Ackermann instincts were dormant,

58
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:48,078
until, in that life-or-death situation,

59
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:51,460
you heard me
order you to "fight."

60
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:56,212
The strength and certainty you felt

61
00:04:56,296 --> 00:05:00,278
in that moment were awakened
because your blood mistook me

62
00:05:00,362 --> 00:05:03,293
for the host you were made to protect.

63
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:06,012
That can't be.

64
00:05:06,096 --> 00:05:08,677
It can't? Why not?

65
00:05:08,761 --> 00:05:11,626
It wasn't a mistake.

66
00:05:18,096 --> 00:05:20,678
It's because it was you.
It had to be you.

67
00:05:20,762 --> 00:05:22,478
You're why I became strong.

68
00:05:22,562 --> 00:05:24,145
How could that be a mistake?

69
00:05:24,229 --> 00:05:26,278
As an Ackermann with awakened powers,

70
00:05:26,362 --> 00:05:30,078
you're apparently supposed to
get headaches pretty frequently.

71
00:05:30,162 --> 00:05:32,012
The research said this is a side-effect

72
00:05:32,096 --> 00:05:34,078
of the Ackermann's
true self trying to resist

73
00:05:34,162 --> 00:05:36,546
being forced to protect their host.

74
00:05:36,629 --> 00:05:38,960
Sound familiar?

75
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:45,478
You're wrong.

76
00:05:45,562 --> 00:05:47,145
What I'm saying is...

77
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:49,678
No. I...

78
00:05:49,762 --> 00:05:52,478
You belong to a clan
created to protect and obey

79
00:05:52,562 --> 00:05:55,278
at the cost of losing their true selves.

80
00:05:55,362 --> 00:05:57,212
In other words: Slaves.

81
00:05:57,296 --> 00:05:58,678
Stop! Leave her alone!

82
00:05:58,762 --> 00:06:00,078
Do you wanna know what I hate

83
00:06:00,162 --> 00:06:03,212
more than anything else in this world?

84
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,346
Anyone who isn't free.

85
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,145
They're no better than cattle.

86
00:06:07,229 --> 00:06:08,478
Eren!

87
00:06:08,561 --> 00:06:12,478
The mere sight of you has
always made me so damn angry.

88
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:15,212
And now I finally know why.

89
00:06:15,296 --> 00:06:19,346
I just couldn't stand to look at
a slave with no mind of her own,

90
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:22,412
who always followed orders
without question.

91
00:06:22,496 --> 00:06:25,611
Believe me when I say this, Mikasa.

92
00:06:25,695 --> 00:06:29,626
Ever since I was a kid, I've hated you.

93
00:06:32,029 --> 00:06:34,960
Eren! How could you
say that to her?

94
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,626
Mikasa?

95
00:06:41,962 --> 00:06:44,545
See? Everything that
you've done in your life

96
00:06:44,629 --> 00:06:47,278
has been dictated by
your Ackermann blood.

97
00:06:47,362 --> 00:06:49,346
No. I... I was just...

98
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:53,493
That blood is all you really are.

99
00:07:06,629 --> 00:07:08,160
Jaeger!

100
00:07:09,029 --> 00:07:11,026
I don't need help.

101
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:13,678
Hey. Armin.

102
00:07:13,762 --> 00:07:18,212
The two of us've never actually
fought before, have we?

103
00:07:18,296 --> 00:07:20,360
You wanna know why that is?

104
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:29,993
It's because...
it'd never be a fair fight!

105
00:07:35,495 --> 00:07:39,012
Please. Just stop.

106
00:07:39,096 --> 00:07:41,012
Like I said at the start.

107
00:07:41,096 --> 00:07:43,477
Conflict isn't necessary.

108
00:07:43,561 --> 00:07:47,078
At least not if you
tell us where Zeke is.

109
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:50,278
So just come along
quietly. Take 'em.

110
00:07:50,362 --> 00:07:51,146
Yes, sir.

111
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:54,127
And bring the kid who killed Sasha, too.

112
00:07:56,762 --> 00:08:00,678
So that's it? That's all
you came here to say?

113
00:08:00,762 --> 00:08:05,477
Is this the freedom you wanted?
The freedom to hurt Mikasa?

114
00:08:05,561 --> 00:08:06,678
You're a slave, too.

115
00:08:06,762 --> 00:08:09,678
And your master is a worthless bastard.

116
00:08:09,762 --> 00:08:14,078
Who are you callin'
a slave? Let's go.

117
00:08:14,162 --> 00:08:15,426
Go where?

118
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:20,593
The place where it
all started. Shiganshina.

119
00:08:25,695 --> 00:08:27,278
It's not even funny.

120
00:08:27,362 --> 00:08:29,078
The piece of shit
we need to feed to a Titan

121
00:08:29,162 --> 00:08:30,293
is right beneath us.

122
00:08:31,495 --> 00:08:33,078
What do you mean?

123
00:08:33,162 --> 00:08:36,146
We'll transfer Zeke's
Beast to some other host.

124
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,611
We just need to grab someone expendable,

125
00:08:37,695 --> 00:08:39,678
like one of these Jaegerists.

126
00:08:39,762 --> 00:08:42,678
Turn them, then feed them Zeke.

127
00:08:42,762 --> 00:08:45,745
I don't know if Eren's
under Zeke's control or not,

128
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:48,078
but I do know that if
the Jaegerists lose Zeke,

129
00:08:48,162 --> 00:08:50,411
their party's over.

130
00:08:50,495 --> 00:08:53,212
Go tell that
to Pyxis. All right?

131
00:08:53,296 --> 00:08:55,078
Are you serious, Captain?

132
00:08:55,162 --> 00:08:57,278
Tell him I'm about to
cut Zeke's limbs off.

133
00:08:57,362 --> 00:08:58,678
That should get him moving.

134
00:08:58,762 --> 00:08:59,626
But...!

135
00:09:06,495 --> 00:09:08,078
Enjoying your book?

136
00:09:08,162 --> 00:09:11,678
As much as possible, for a book
I've read seven times.

137
00:09:11,762 --> 00:09:13,478
Seems to me that you've
been eavesdropping

138
00:09:13,562 --> 00:09:15,078
more than you've been reading.

139
00:09:15,162 --> 00:09:16,346
Can you really blame me when I've

140
00:09:16,429 --> 00:09:18,411
read the book this many times?

141
00:09:18,495 --> 00:09:21,478
By the way, is there any wine left?

142
00:09:21,562 --> 00:09:23,411
Of course not, we've been here a month.

143
00:09:23,495 --> 00:09:25,478
There isn't a single drop left.

144
00:09:25,562 --> 00:09:28,146
Damn, too bad.

145
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:31,027
You're a real expert
torturer, ya know that?

146
00:09:32,361 --> 00:09:34,078
Just read your book.

147
00:09:34,162 --> 00:09:37,146
As you command, Captain.

148
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:41,146
I'm chopping him up
no matter what Pyxis says.

149
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:46,012
We have 30 fully-armed soldiers
waiting in the trees up above.

150
00:09:46,096 --> 00:09:49,559
Even if Zeke becomes the Beast,
there's no way he'll escape.

151
00:09:50,495 --> 00:09:54,478
That bearded piece of
shit was our enemy after all.

152
00:09:54,562 --> 00:09:57,212
Now that we know that,
he's just a hostage.

153
00:09:57,296 --> 00:09:59,993
And hostages don't need limbs.

154
00:10:00,896 --> 00:10:05,212
It took long enough. Erwin.

155
00:10:05,296 --> 00:10:08,559
I can finally make good on
the promise I made you.

156
00:10:09,296 --> 00:10:12,146
There was meaning in your deaths.

157
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:15,559
At last. I can prove it.

158
00:10:31,362 --> 00:10:32,492
Hey.

159
00:11:04,229 --> 00:11:05,212
Whoa. What was that?

160
00:11:05,295 --> 00:11:07,079
My body went numb for a second.

161
00:11:07,163 --> 00:11:08,012
So did mine.

162
00:11:08,096 --> 00:11:10,227
Huh? I didn't feel a thing.

163
00:11:17,229 --> 00:11:18,411
What's the matter?

164
00:11:18,495 --> 00:11:21,545
I feel like I just got
shocked by electricity.

165
00:11:21,629 --> 00:11:24,478
Wait, does that mean...?

166
00:11:24,562 --> 00:11:28,093
Zeke's done it, hasn't he?

167
00:11:29,362 --> 00:11:31,411
This is goodbye, Captain.

168
00:11:31,495 --> 00:11:33,012
You're a caring leader.

169
00:11:33,096 --> 00:11:35,278
And your soldiers haven't
done anything wrong.

170
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:36,411
You wouldn't slice 'em up

171
00:11:36,495 --> 00:11:39,060
just 'cause they've grown
a bit, now would you?

172
00:11:48,562 --> 00:11:49,945
Wine?

173
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:51,679
Why would we bring wine on a mission?

174
00:11:51,763 --> 00:11:54,611
Please, Captain!
This is rare Marleyan wine!

175
00:11:54,695 --> 00:11:57,545
The MPs have been hoarding
most of it for themselves!

176
00:11:57,629 --> 00:11:59,679
Don't we deserve a treat, too?

177
00:11:59,763 --> 00:12:01,211
We've got tea.

178
00:12:01,295 --> 00:12:03,278
Captain!

179
00:12:03,362 --> 00:12:07,192
Gimme a break. Fine. Bring it.

180
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:14,478
Shit. Zeke's spinal fluid
was in the wine? Since when?

181
00:12:14,562 --> 00:12:18,593
Not a single person
froze up! Was it all a lie?

182
00:12:19,495 --> 00:12:22,211
Damn it. They're fast.

183
00:12:22,295 --> 00:12:24,012
How are they able to move like this?

184
00:12:24,096 --> 00:12:25,893
Is that because of Zeke, too?

185
00:12:35,362 --> 00:12:38,127
Varis.

186
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:45,159
Are you still somewhere in there?

187
00:12:46,562 --> 00:12:48,060
You guys.

188
00:12:59,763 --> 00:13:01,479
It's too bad.

189
00:13:01,563 --> 00:13:05,211
In the end, we couldn't trust each other.

190
00:13:05,295 --> 00:13:07,211
Before long, all the world's might

191
00:13:07,295 --> 00:13:09,411
will fall upon this island.

192
00:13:09,495 --> 00:13:12,945
You could never comprehend
what that means.

193
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:15,345
After the raid on Liberio,
you thought that you had

194
00:13:15,429 --> 00:13:18,278
power, time, and options
to choose between,

195
00:13:18,362 --> 00:13:20,945
but the truth is that
you had none of those.

196
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:24,159
And that led to your downfall.

197
00:13:24,895 --> 00:13:28,211
Still, even if I'd
explained my intentions,

198
00:13:28,295 --> 00:13:31,211
you wouldn't have understood.

199
00:13:31,295 --> 00:13:33,679
Right, Eren?

200
00:13:33,763 --> 00:13:37,411
Only we understand.

201
00:13:37,495 --> 00:13:42,411
Once I'm out of this forest,
I'll be with you in no time.

202
00:13:42,495 --> 00:13:43,611
I'm worried.

203
00:13:43,695 --> 00:13:47,226
You do remember when and where
we agreed to meet. Right?

204
00:13:54,495 --> 00:13:56,159
Kill him!

205
00:14:02,429 --> 00:14:04,345
Huh? Come on, not again!

206
00:14:04,429 --> 00:14:07,159
Damn it! What the hell
are you made of?

207
00:14:24,963 --> 00:14:27,611
Where did you go?

208
00:14:27,695 --> 00:14:31,226
Come on out, Levi! Fight me!

209
00:14:34,695 --> 00:14:36,493
There you are.

210
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:47,145
Where did all your cute
little soldier friends go?

211
00:14:47,229 --> 00:14:51,960
Don't tell me you killed
'em all! The poor things!

212
00:14:59,095 --> 00:15:00,345
A branch?

213
00:15:00,429 --> 00:15:03,012
You look desperate, hairball.

214
00:15:03,095 --> 00:15:06,159
All you had to do was
read your damn book.

215
00:15:09,095 --> 00:15:13,411
What gave you the idea
that you could escape from me?

216
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,011
If you really thought I'd hesitate to

217
00:15:15,095 --> 00:15:18,411
kill my comrades once you turned them,

218
00:15:18,495 --> 00:15:22,960
then you have no idea how
many friends I've had to kill.

219
00:15:52,363 --> 00:15:55,278
Ah. Hey, Beardy.

220
00:15:55,362 --> 00:15:58,211
Amazing. You've gotten
uglier somehow.

221
00:15:58,295 --> 00:16:01,345
You even smell worse. Shitbag.

222
00:16:01,429 --> 00:16:06,426
Well, don't worry.
I'm not gonna kill you. Not yet.

223
00:16:09,629 --> 00:16:13,345
As you know,
Premier Zachary's assassination

224
00:16:13,429 --> 00:16:15,411
has destabilized the military

225
00:16:15,495 --> 00:16:18,411
and the general state of
affairs within the walls.

226
00:16:18,495 --> 00:16:21,545
However. That has nothing
to do with you cadets.

227
00:16:21,629 --> 00:16:24,545
Which is why the 109th Cadet Corps

228
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:26,611
will practice defending
Shiganshina District

229
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:29,193
from Titan attack, just as planned.

230
00:16:36,363 --> 00:16:37,411
Do you hear me?

231
00:16:37,495 --> 00:16:38,612
Uh. Yes, sir!

232
00:16:38,696 --> 00:16:40,211
Glad to hear it, Cadet...

233
00:16:40,295 --> 00:16:41,612
Why are we still being taught how to

234
00:16:41,696 --> 00:16:43,945
cut a Titan's nape with a blade?

235
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:45,545
It's not like they'll attack again.

236
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,411
Our enemies are all human now.

237
00:16:47,495 --> 00:16:49,679
My old man was saying the same thing.

238
00:16:49,763 --> 00:16:51,411
He thinks we should train with firearms

239
00:16:51,495 --> 00:16:54,011
and form a new Eldian army.

240
00:16:54,095 --> 00:16:56,345
It's all too obvious
that the times have changed,

241
00:16:56,429 --> 00:16:59,945
but Commandant Shadis
is stuck in the past.

242
00:17:00,029 --> 00:17:02,211
If there's any hope for Eldia's future,

243
00:17:02,295 --> 00:17:04,612
it's in the Jaegerists
taking power by force.

244
00:17:04,696 --> 00:17:07,411
Stop, Surma. He'll hear you.

245
00:17:07,495 --> 00:17:10,345
So what? You all
feel the same, right?

246
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:14,011
I'm sure that everyone here
wants Eren Jaeger to lead Eldia.

247
00:17:14,095 --> 00:17:16,345
We need a strong, capable leader

248
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:18,593
who can make hard decisions.

249
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:26,679
Hange?

250
00:17:26,763 --> 00:17:29,211
Long time no see, Commandant.

251
00:17:29,295 --> 00:17:30,612
Sorry to interrupt,

252
00:17:30,696 --> 00:17:34,011
but we'll be occupying
this facility for a while.

253
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,145
As you may have heard,

254
00:17:35,229 --> 00:17:38,211
we're a group known as the Jaegerists.

255
00:17:38,295 --> 00:17:39,211
And if you don't wanna die,

256
00:17:39,295 --> 00:17:42,211
you'll follow our
instructions to the letter.

257
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:43,612
It's the Jaegerists.

258
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:45,545
Congratulations, you finally figured out

259
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:47,545
where you stand, Floch.

260
00:17:47,629 --> 00:17:49,545
No one gives a damn about your gang.

261
00:17:49,629 --> 00:17:52,011
There's only one way
you can get our attention.

262
00:17:52,095 --> 00:17:54,945
That's to grab a bunch of guns
and start waving them around.

263
00:17:55,029 --> 00:17:56,260
How long did...

264
00:18:00,696 --> 00:18:01,612
What's with you?

265
00:18:01,696 --> 00:18:05,211
Barely missed. I figured
I could speed things up

266
00:18:05,295 --> 00:18:07,612
by shooting the Commandant in the foot.

267
00:18:07,696 --> 00:18:09,279
What do you want from me?

268
00:18:09,363 --> 00:18:12,411
Nothing. This isn't about you.

269
00:18:12,495 --> 00:18:14,078
Our movement doesn't have any use for

270
00:18:14,162 --> 00:18:17,612
old men with hard heads and little else.

271
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:22,959
Listen, Cadets. Starting
right now, this is your time!

272
00:18:24,029 --> 00:18:26,612
Eldia's in grave danger,
but we Jaegerists

273
00:18:26,696 --> 00:18:29,145
are doing everything
we can to protect her.

274
00:18:29,229 --> 00:18:31,411
We've pledged our hearts and souls!

275
00:18:31,495 --> 00:18:32,679
We are fighting.

276
00:18:32,763 --> 00:18:35,145
Not for the fossils in
command of our military,

277
00:18:35,229 --> 00:18:38,011
but for the people of
the island we call home.

278
00:18:38,095 --> 00:18:41,211
If you keep complying with the
archaic mindset of our leaders,

279
00:18:41,295 --> 00:18:43,345
then the day will soon come
when you're forced to

280
00:18:43,429 --> 00:18:46,011
watch helplessly as our enemies crush us!

281
00:18:46,095 --> 00:18:49,945
So I ask each of you this:
Who would you rather be?

282
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:52,011
Someone who lives to see the future

283
00:18:52,095 --> 00:18:54,945
alongside Eren Jaeger,
the leader of Eldia?

284
00:18:55,029 --> 00:18:56,411
Or someone who dies,

285
00:18:56,495 --> 00:18:58,679
alongside Commandant Keith Shadis

286
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:01,527
and the antiquated ways of the past.

287
00:19:08,696 --> 00:19:12,211
For the sake of Eldia's
future, we dedicate our hearts!

288
00:19:12,295 --> 00:19:13,411
That's good.

289
00:19:13,495 --> 00:19:16,011
But now I need to see you
demonstrate your resolve.

290
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:18,211
I want you to beat up
the Commandant here mercilessly

291
00:19:18,295 --> 00:19:19,744
until he can't stand anymore.

292
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:21,926
What?

293
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,011
He represents the obsolete traditions

294
00:19:25,095 --> 00:19:26,612
that we need to do away with.

295
00:19:26,696 --> 00:19:28,679
So purge him at once!

296
00:19:28,762 --> 00:19:31,612
Anyone who refuses will be detained!

297
00:19:31,696 --> 00:19:33,612
Come on, this is ridiculous!

298
00:19:33,696 --> 00:19:35,078
You've made your point, Floch!

299
00:19:35,162 --> 00:19:36,260
Hange!

300
00:19:38,229 --> 00:19:40,679
No matter how many of
these weak brats come at me,

301
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,926
there won't be nearly enough!

302
00:19:53,163 --> 00:19:54,545
Well done.

303
00:19:54,629 --> 00:19:57,945
We're delighted to welcome each of you.

304
00:19:58,029 --> 00:20:00,211
Now then. If it's
not too inconvenient,

305
00:20:00,295 --> 00:20:02,593
guide us to where Zeke's being held.

306
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:06,560
Commander Hange.

307
00:20:08,029 --> 00:20:10,093
Hey. Let's go.

308
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:30,060
Are you awake?

309
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:35,011
Hey. Stop that. No sudden moves.

310
00:20:35,095 --> 00:20:36,545
I stuck a thunder spear in your gut,

311
00:20:36,629 --> 00:20:40,011
and attached the fuse to the
wire wrapped around your neck.

312
00:20:40,095 --> 00:20:44,126
Squirm too much and you'll be
blown in half. At least.

313
00:20:53,363 --> 00:20:56,479
I bet you wish you were dead right now.

314
00:20:56,563 --> 00:21:00,211
Not that I sympathize. Bastard.

315
00:21:00,295 --> 00:21:03,079
You used my comrades like cheap toys.

316
00:21:03,163 --> 00:21:05,678
When you planned this,
did you think you'd end up here?

317
00:21:05,762 --> 00:21:07,626
Sobbing into your own filth?

318
00:21:10,295 --> 00:21:11,612
Shut your mouth.

319
00:21:11,695 --> 00:21:13,612
I have no choice but to
hack you into pieces.

320
00:21:13,695 --> 00:21:16,460
If I don't, you'll turn
into a Titan again!

321
00:21:28,295 --> 00:21:32,211
Hey, Levi. Where are my glasses?

322
00:21:32,295 --> 00:21:34,211
Huh? What's it matter?

323
00:21:34,295 --> 00:21:37,160
You don't have any need
for glasses anymore.

324
00:21:41,095 --> 00:21:43,145
Whoa. Nice one, Zeke!

325
00:21:43,229 --> 00:21:45,360
You're gettin' to be a proper pitcher.

326
00:21:54,963 --> 00:21:57,560
Ever think about playing ball
when you grow up?

327
00:21:58,963 --> 00:22:03,011
I'm sorry, but I can't,
Mr. Ksaver.

328
00:22:03,095 --> 00:22:05,893
I have a mission.

329
00:23:40,949 --> 00:23:43,533
He summons up long-missed faces,

330
00:23:43,617 --> 00:23:46,865
and memories from his faded past.

331
00:23:46,949 --> 00:23:48,865
With them comes a reminder

332
00:23:48,949 --> 00:23:52,265
of what he must do to
achieve his mission.

333
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:54,781
Next episode: "Sole Salvation."
