[EREN]
My name is Eren Jaeger.

3
00:00:31,196 --> 00:00:34,116
I'm addressing my fellow
Subjects of Ymir.

4
00:00:34,196 --> 00:00:38,036
Speaking to you directly through
the power of the Founder.

5
00:00:38,126 --> 00:00:40,246
All the walls on
the island of Paradis

6
00:00:40,336 --> 00:00:42,456
have crumbled to the ground,

7
00:00:42,546 --> 00:00:47,466
and the legions of Titans buried
within have begun their march.

8
00:00:47,546 --> 00:00:50,136
My only goal is to protect

9
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,176
the lives of the
people of Paradis,

10
00:00:52,256 --> 00:00:55,306
the island where I was born.

11
00:00:55,386 --> 00:00:58,476
Right now, the nations of
the world are united

12
00:00:58,556 --> 00:01:01,816
in their desire to
exterminate my people,

13
00:01:01,896 --> 00:01:04,396
and it won't end
with our island.

14
00:01:04,476 --> 00:01:06,026
They won't be satisfied until

15
00:01:06,106 --> 00:01:09,026
every last Subject
of Ymir is dead.

16
00:01:09,106 --> 00:01:12,446
I won't let them have their way.

17
00:01:12,526 --> 00:01:15,996
The Titans of the Walls
will continue their march

18
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:20,536
until every trace of life beyond
our shores is trampled flat

19
00:01:20,626 --> 00:01:25,706

all that remains of humanity.

It leaves you helpless.

It screws up your memories, too.

too important to leave behind.

slaughter everyone
who lives outside the walls.

71
00:06:21,716 --> 00:06:23,546
But when he's done,

72
00:06:23,636 --> 00:06:27,176
everyone who hates us
will be dead.

73
00:06:27,256 --> 00:06:31,136
The entire outside world
was a threat to our existence,

74
00:06:31,226 --> 00:06:35,516
and now it's going to be
trampled flat and left empty.

These people called us
"island devils."

unless they killed us first.

We became what
they thought we were,

78

they feared we'd do,

79
00:06:45,736 --> 00:06:47,996
because we have to.

80
00:06:48,076 --> 00:06:50,746
In the end, it's on them.

81
00:06:50,826 --> 00:06:51,866
This is only happening because

82
00:06:51,956 --> 00:06:54,746

a fight and lost.

83
00:06:54,826 --> 00:06:55,916

differently, was there?

91
00:07:19,186 --> 00:07:20,776
Eren tricked Zeke

castrating us all with
his euthanization plan.

And Historia could've
taken the Founder,

94
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:30,786
but Eren opposed that 'cause
it would've cost her life.

95
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:34,746
He did this for his friends.

96
00:07:34,826 --> 00:07:36,576
Eren wants to protect us,
even if it means

00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,876
killing everybody else
on the planet.

more horrible

going after our soldiers?

the Founder's power.

one of Marley's
Warrior candidates,

123
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,206

the rest of his unit

Marley is about
to be trampled flat,
