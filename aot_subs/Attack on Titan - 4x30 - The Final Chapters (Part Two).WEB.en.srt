00:00:03,253 --> 00:00:04,753
[ELDIAN DAUGHTER B]
What's that?

2
00:00:06,883 --> 00:00:08,763
In the clouds.

3
00:00:19,183 --> 00:00:21,393
Target sighted! Prepare to jump!

4
00:00:21,483 --> 00:00:23,863
What about you?
Hurry up and get over here!

5
00:00:23,943 --> 00:00:25,153
I'm staying.

6
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:28,403
We're gonna drop you
straight onto the target!

7
00:00:28,493 --> 00:00:30,953
Let me worry about getting
this thing back down.

8
00:00:31,033 --> 00:00:34,033
Don't jump till you're damn sure
you'll land on the Founder!

9
00:00:34,123 --> 00:00:36,003
Onyankopon!

10
00:00:41,373 --> 00:00:43,793
Furry shitbag.

11
00:00:43,883 --> 00:00:46,263
The Beast is in the field!

12
00:00:46,343 --> 00:00:48,383
Good, then we don't
have to look for him!

13
00:00:48,463 --> 00:00:51,253
You know the plan.
The Beast Titan is priority one!

14
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:54,303
Destroying him could end
this battle in one shot!

15
00:00:54,393 --> 00:00:56,893
It's time to stop the rumbling!

16
00:01:07,193 --> 00:01:08,733
Now!

17
00:01:10,493 --> 00:01:12,283
[Grunts]

18
00:01:13,613 --> 00:01:15,703
Eren!

19
00:01:42,683 --> 00:01:45,563
[CONNY]
Shit. I can't touch down!

20
00:01:50,073 --> 00:01:52,413
[Yells]

21
00:02:03,543 --> 00:02:05,503
Hang on, Reiner!

22
00:02:11,093 --> 00:02:13,633
[Grunting]

23
00:02:20,433 --> 00:02:22,473
[MARLEYAN SOLDIER A]
That's the Armored Titan,

24
00:02:22,563 --> 00:02:24,983
and the Cart Titan's there, too!

25
00:02:25,063 --> 00:02:28,313
All those soldiers are wearing
ODM gear. It's them.

26
00:02:28,403 --> 00:02:31,703
The forces of Paradis are
trying to end the rumbling!

27
00:02:33,233 --> 00:02:35,153
[KARINA]
Reiner!

28
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:41,203
[ARMIN]
Eren.

29
00:02:41,283 --> 00:02:44,333
You said there was nothing
to say, but you were wrong.

30
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:48,333
I've got a question
and you will answer it.

31
00:02:48,423 --> 00:02:51,763
What do you really mean
when you say you're free?

32
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:33,373
Looks like that was
just an empty husk.

33
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,383
Killing it accomplished nothing.

34
00:03:35,463 --> 00:03:36,633
[ARMIN]
As I feared.

35
00:03:36,713 --> 00:03:38,553
The War Hammer's
abilities are being used

36
00:03:38,578 --> 00:03:41,078
to hide the real Zeke
somewhere in the Founding Titan.

37
00:03:41,433 --> 00:03:43,491
What, you're telling us
that we have to root out

38
00:03:43,516 --> 00:03:45,933
one tiny human body from
this giant mess of bones?

39
00:03:46,023 --> 00:03:49,273
There's no way.
It can't be done!

40
00:03:49,353 --> 00:03:52,443
I'm sorry, Armin, but it's time
to face the facts! You have--

41
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:53,733
Yeah, I know!

42
00:03:53,823 --> 00:03:55,163
[BOTH gasp]

43
00:03:56,863 --> 00:04:00,323
Exactly one minute from now,
I'll blast these bones apart.

44
00:04:00,413 --> 00:04:02,703
Use the Cart to get clear!

45
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,833
[MIKASA]
Armin.

46
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,123
Eren's aware that this
attack might be coming,

47
00:04:08,203 --> 00:04:10,413
so I can't imagine
this'll kill him!

48
00:04:10,503 --> 00:04:14,383
But still, if I do enough
damage to the Founding Titan,

49
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:17,553
we might be able to find
Zeke and Eren's bodies!

50
00:04:19,553 --> 00:04:21,143
Be careful, Armin!

51
00:04:21,223 --> 00:04:24,023
[JEAN] If you get into trouble,
don't worry about us.

52
00:04:24,103 --> 00:04:26,523
Just transform on the spot!

53
00:04:31,693 --> 00:04:33,943
[ARMIN] Those who can't
sacrifice anything

54
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,983
can't change anything.

55
00:04:36,073 --> 00:04:37,363
I know that.

56
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:42,113
If I can't let it go,
its not worth holding on to.

57
00:04:42,203 --> 00:04:46,043
No more clinging to
false hope for comfort.

58
00:04:46,123 --> 00:04:49,003
I have to deal with Eren.

59
00:04:52,373 --> 00:04:53,503
Armin!

60
00:04:53,583 --> 00:04:54,833
[Gasps]

61
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:06,513
Armin!

62
00:05:06,538 --> 00:05:08,818
[All gasps]

63
00:05:24,703 --> 00:05:28,663
[ELDIAN A]
Three, two, and pull!

64
00:05:28,743 --> 00:05:30,203
[YOUNG ELDIAN A]
He's not moving.

65
00:05:30,293 --> 00:05:32,583
[DOCTOR A]
But he is breathing.

66
00:05:32,663 --> 00:05:34,703
He took a bad hit to the head.

67
00:05:34,728 --> 00:05:37,061
Do you think he
brought those soldiers from Pardis?

68
00:05:37,093 --> 00:05:40,553
Uh! Hey! Can you hear me?

69
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:42,883
Annie Leonhart! Do you know her?

70
00:05:42,973 --> 00:05:45,683
She's my daughter!
I need to find her!

71
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:48,563
Please, sir. Answer me!

72
00:05:50,773 --> 00:05:53,443
Reiner! They're coming!

73
00:05:56,443 --> 00:05:58,573
[Yells]

74
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,413
What the hell are these things?

75
00:06:21,503 --> 00:06:23,713
[JEAN] Judging from their
looks and how they act,

76
00:06:23,803 --> 00:06:25,643
they don't seem
like Pure Titans.

77
00:06:25,723 --> 00:06:28,223
What now? We're gonna run
out of Thunder Spears soon.

78
00:06:28,303 --> 00:06:31,013
More importantly, we need
to find out if Armin's okay!

79
00:06:31,103 --> 00:06:32,983
If he'd received so
much as a papercut,

80
00:06:33,063 --> 00:06:35,103
he'd've transformed on the spot.

81
00:06:35,193 --> 00:06:39,193
Which means he's being
restrained, but he's not hurt.

82
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:42,823
The problem is that he was
whisked off towards Eren's ass

83
00:06:42,903 --> 00:06:46,073
and there are countless
Titans blocking our path.

84
00:06:46,153 --> 00:06:48,033
Even if I were in perfect shape,

85
00:06:48,113 --> 00:06:50,703
charging into that
wouldn't be my Plan A.

86
00:06:50,783 --> 00:06:54,373
So stay calm, and let's think.

87
00:06:54,453 --> 00:06:56,543
Mikasa, listen to me.

88
00:06:56,623 --> 00:06:57,753
Before you rush in there,

89
00:06:57,833 --> 00:07:00,583
let me try and draw
the bulk of them away.

90
00:07:00,608 --> 00:07:02,948
That isn't going
to work, Captain.

91
00:07:02,973 --> 00:07:05,353
I've figured out what
we're dealing with.

92
00:07:05,378 --> 00:07:06,548
These husks...

93
00:07:06,573 --> 00:07:07,948
[PIECK TITAN]
...are all the people

94
00:07:07,973 --> 00:07:10,103
who bore the Power
of the Nine before us.

95
00:07:10,183 --> 00:07:13,353
I don't know if their minds
are still in there or not.

96
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,893
But I'm betting the Founding
Titan has the ability

97
00:07:15,983 --> 00:07:19,443
to resurrect them as many
times as it needs to.

98
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:23,193
This army of battle-tested
Titans was built for one reason:

99
00:07:23,273 --> 00:07:24,443
to fight.

100
00:07:24,533 --> 00:07:27,033
There's no way.
We can't beat that.

101
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,203
[PIECK TITAN]
Agreed.

102
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:29,413
Which means we can't afford

103
00:07:29,493 --> 00:07:31,283
to be so easy going with this.

104
00:07:31,373 --> 00:07:34,793
And, well, I'm not even
friends with Eren.

105
00:07:34,873 --> 00:07:36,003
Huh?

106
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:38,543
Hey, what are you--?
Pieck, wait!

107
00:07:38,623 --> 00:07:40,463
Damn it to hell.

108
00:07:55,231 --> 00:07:56,551
No matter how you look at it,

109
00:07:56,576 --> 00:07:58,103
the head's the place
to hit first!

110
00:07:58,183 --> 00:08:00,683
This has been my
goal from the start!

111
00:08:03,023 --> 00:08:04,613
No! Wait!

112
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,533

[LEVI growls]

120
00:08:45,863 --> 00:08:48,653
Focus. We need to
save Armin, and fast.

121
00:08:48,743 --> 00:08:50,953
That's our only path
through this mess.

122
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:54,743
Without him, all of us
will die here for nothing.

123
00:08:55,096 --> 00:08:56,718
[MARLEYAN SOLDIER A]
A force from Paradis

124
00:08:56,743 --> 00:08:58,413
has engaged the Attack Titan,

125
00:08:58,503 --> 00:09:01,133
but the trajectory of the
rumbling hasn't changed!

126
00:09:01,213 --> 00:09:04,713
If this keeps up we'll
still be trampled!

127
00:09:04,793 --> 00:09:07,583
Well, we can't just sit
back and do nothing.

128
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:10,303
All troops, meet the
enemy with cannonfire.

--[MARLEYAN SOLDIER B] Sir!
--Uh. Pardon, sir.

130
00:09:12,263 --> 00:09:13,763
But the vast majority
of our personnel

131
00:09:13,843 --> 00:09:15,763
were deployed ealier
on the airships.

132
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:17,038
With the troops we have left,

133
00:09:17,063 --> 00:09:19,353
we'll struggle to man
even three cannons.

134
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,393
That may be so,
but its no reason

135
00:09:21,483 --> 00:09:23,648
for us to sit back
and do nothing.

136
00:09:25,403 --> 00:09:28,703
As we speak, a few brave people
are fighting desperately

137
00:09:28,783 --> 00:09:30,913
on that monstrosity's back.

138

they're fighting for?

[ARMIN]
I was naive.

144
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:26,373
My mind's fading.

145
00:10:26,463 --> 00:10:28,553
After everything
we've been through,

146
00:10:28,633 --> 00:10:32,133
you're just gonna
suffocate me...

147
00:10:32,213 --> 00:10:34,463
...Eren?

148
00:10:34,553 --> 00:10:40,013
No, this isn't him. It's her.

149
00:10:40,103 --> 00:10:41,943
Eren said he'd move forward

150
00:10:42,023 --> 00:10:44,563
while leaving all of us
free to oppose him,

151
00:10:44,643 --> 00:10:47,233
so this resistance is
coming from the Founder.

152
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,193
It's the will of Ymir.

153
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:52,653
She's not under his control
any more than we are.

154

genocide to happen.

nothing I can do.

00:13:01,953 --> 00:13:06,163
for a Titan with that name,
it sure does break a lot.

178
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:09,293
[REINER]
Do you still think we can win?

179
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:12,213
[JEAN]
Nope. But I don't care.

180
00:13:12,293 --> 00:13:15,503
I wanna fight to the bitter end.

181
00:13:15,593 --> 00:13:17,013
We're Scouts, Reiner.

182
00:13:17,093 --> 00:13:19,593
Not knowing when to give up
is what makes us who we are.

183
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,053
[Gasps]

184
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:25,053
Okay.

185
00:13:31,983 --> 00:13:33,823
[Gasps]

186
00:13:33,848 --> 00:13:35,348
No!

187
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:40,653
[LEVI yells]

188
00:13:41,953 --> 00:13:43,491
[MIKASA yells]

189
00:13:43,516 --> 00:13:44,588
[Gasps]

190
00:13:44,613 --> 00:13:46,283
[CONNY]
Captain!

191
00:14:04,633 --> 00:14:06,223
[MIKASA]
Bring it on!

192
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,893
I'm stronger than
any of you, got it?!

193
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,433
So you'd better come
at me at once,

194
00:14:10,523 --> 00:14:11,523
'cause no matter how--

195
00:14:11,603 --> 00:14:14,903
[ANNIE]
You're kinda in the way, Mikasa!

196
00:14:14,983 --> 00:14:16,613
Grab on!

197
00:14:39,293 --> 00:14:40,623
I know.

198
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,173
Honestly, I never imagined

199
00:14:42,263 --> 00:14:44,933
that a Titan would be
able to fly, either.

200
00:14:45,013 --> 00:14:48,223
But he pulled it off,
so here I am.

201
00:14:48,303 --> 00:14:50,303
Didn't have much choice.

202
00:14:52,723 --> 00:14:56,223
That said, I'm glad to be here.

203
00:14:58,483 --> 00:15:00,733
[ELDIAN C] A bird.
It's got people on its back!

204
00:15:00,823 --> 00:15:02,993
[ELDIANS chattering]

205
00:15:03,073 --> 00:15:05,413
[REINER] And you, Gabi?
Why are you here?

206
00:15:05,493 --> 00:15:08,033
[GABI] Because I can fight!
Isn't that obvious?

207
00:15:08,113 --> 00:15:10,113
You guys never should've
left us behind!

208
00:15:10,203 --> 00:15:11,913
Annie!

209
00:15:11,993 --> 00:15:15,163
Look, the Azumabito's
ship ended up sinking.

210
00:15:15,253 --> 00:15:17,003
[Gasps]

211
00:15:17,083 --> 00:15:21,003
[ANNIE] It couldn't withstand
Falco's Titan transformation.

212
00:15:21,093 --> 00:15:23,553
Even though we had no
proof he could fly,

213
00:15:23,633 --> 00:15:26,633
Kiyomi agreed to let
him make an attempt.

214
00:15:26,723 --> 00:15:29,473
She put her faith in us,
and now we need to live up to it

215
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:32,513
by doing what it takes
to stop the rumbling!

216
00:15:32,603 --> 00:15:34,063
Gabi.

217
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,523
Hang on, where's Arm--
I mean, where's Pieck?

218
00:15:37,603 --> 00:15:40,233
[MIKASA] Armin was captured.
His life's in danger.

219
00:15:40,258 --> 00:15:41,609
[Gasps]

220
00:15:41,634 --> 00:15:44,258
[MIKASA] The Titan that took him
should be back by the tailbone.

221
00:15:44,283 --> 00:15:47,083
Annie, we need your help.

222
00:15:47,153 --> 00:15:48,993
Your childhood friends
sure do have a way

223
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,413
of getting themselves captured.

224
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:53,583
But yeah, I'll help
you get him back.

225
00:15:53,663 --> 00:15:55,043
[GABI]
What about Pieck?

226
00:15:55,123 --> 00:15:56,503
[REINER]
She's by the skull.

227
00:15:56,583 --> 00:15:58,293
She tried to blast the nape,

228
00:15:58,373 --> 00:16:00,253
but the War Hammer
Titan caught her.

229
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:01,873
[GABI]
To blast it?

230
00:16:01,963 --> 00:16:04,463
[LEVI] We're gonna need
to split up. Agh.

231
00:16:04,553 --> 00:16:06,643
Captain!

232
00:16:06,713 --> 00:16:09,173
One group will go to
the tail and save Armin.

233
00:16:09,263 --> 00:16:12,223
We're gonna need the
Colossal Titan's explosion.

234
00:16:12,248 --> 00:16:14,118
The other group will move
towards Eren's head

235
00:16:14,143 --> 00:16:16,773
and try to blow up his neck.

236
00:16:16,853 --> 00:16:20,443
We'll form two teams and
launch a two-pronged assault.

237
00:16:20,523 --> 00:16:24,823
We no longer have the luxury
of worrying about Eren.

238
00:16:24,903 --> 00:16:28,493
Hell, we never had
it to begin with.

239
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:32,453
[MIKASA]
But, Captain--

240
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,913
[CONNY]
But what?

241
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,493
If Falco hadn't miraculously
flown in and saved us,

242
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,713
we'd already be dead!

243
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,333
That's right.

244
00:16:41,423 --> 00:16:43,463
And we wouldn't have
accomplished a single thing.

245
00:16:43,543 --> 00:16:44,713
You, too?

246
00:16:44,793 --> 00:16:46,253
Damn it.

247
00:16:46,343 --> 00:16:49,303
I had a long list of things to
tell that dumbass off about.

248
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,513
Shit.

249
00:16:50,593 --> 00:16:53,133
Look, I don't wanna
give up on Eren, either!

250
00:16:53,223 --> 00:16:55,143
But hell, thanks
to my screw-up,

251
00:16:55,223 --> 00:16:57,643
the captain can barely
fight at this point.

252
00:16:57,723 --> 00:16:59,143
And even if he were fine,

253
00:16:59,233 --> 00:17:01,323
we're up against
the Founding Titan!

254
00:17:01,393 --> 00:17:03,893
How can we win if we hold back?

255
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:13,323
Mikasa. I'm sorry.

256
00:17:13,413 --> 00:17:17,333
But our only choice
is to kill Eren.

257
00:17:17,413 --> 00:17:18,913
[Gasps]

258
00:17:19,003 --> 00:17:21,293
[ANNIE]
Mikasa. Mikasa.

259
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:22,543
Mikasa!

260
00:17:22,623 --> 00:17:26,623
You can just concentrate
on rescuing Armin, okay?

261
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,423
[Gasps]

262
00:17:28,513 --> 00:17:32,393
Leave the rest to them. You
don't have to think about it.

263
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,263
[MARLEYAN SOLDIERS gasp]

264
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,378
It looks like they're
about to make

265
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:50,738
another run at the Attack Titan!

266
00:17:50,763 --> 00:17:52,188
We can't give up either!

267
00:17:52,213 --> 00:17:53,824
Even if it's just
a couple cannons,

268
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:55,453
it's better than nothing!

269
00:17:58,623 --> 00:18:00,333
Are those refugees?

270
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,833
[MARLEYAN OFFICER A]
No. Look close.

271
00:18:02,913 --> 00:18:06,833
Their sleeves are faded where
the armbands used to be.

272
00:18:06,923 --> 00:18:09,013
You're Eldians, right?

273
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:13,093
Wait. Let's keep our heads.

274
00:18:13,173 --> 00:18:15,673
We've got wounded.
We only came to seek aid.

275
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:17,853
Yeah, well, we don't
have time to give it!

276
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:19,973
Now tell us why
you're really here!

277
00:18:20,063 --> 00:18:22,103
It's like I told you,
Mr. Leonhart.

278
00:18:22,128 --> 00:18:24,338
Marleyans will never
help us willingly.

279
00:18:24,683 --> 00:18:26,540
[ELDIAN F] Good thing
we outnumber them, then.

280
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:28,523
Probably have more
combat experience, too.

281
00:18:28,613 --> 00:18:30,113
[YOUNG ELDIAN MAN A]
Bet you're right.

282
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:32,943
We're the ones they sent to die
on the front lines after all.

283
00:18:34,903 --> 00:18:36,943
[MARLEYAN SOLDIER B]
Drop your guns, Eldians!

284
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:39,663
[ANNIE'S DAD]
Stop!

285
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,333
[CONDUCTOR A] Drop your
guns like you were told!

286
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:46,043
[ANNIE'S DAD] You?
Conductor, since when did--?

287
00:18:54,473 --> 00:18:57,563
[Footsteps]

288
00:18:57,643 --> 00:18:59,483
[MARLEYAN ARTILLERYMAN A]
Secretary Müller!

289
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:06,893
[ANNIE'S DAD gasps]

290
00:19:10,323 --> 00:19:12,953
[Gunshots]

291
00:19:13,033 --> 00:19:14,163
Gunshots?

292
00:19:14,243 --> 00:19:17,243
People are still trying
to kill each other?

293
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:20,573
Falco! Look out for projectiles!

294
00:19:21,913 --> 00:19:23,083
[Gasps]

295
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,503
[REINER]
Incoming!

296
00:19:36,513 --> 00:19:39,513
[Yells]

297
00:19:44,023 --> 00:19:45,403
Jean! Reiner!

298
00:19:45,483 --> 00:19:47,773
You'd better not get killed!

299
00:19:49,603 --> 00:19:52,983
Right. Same goes for you guys.

300
00:19:53,073 --> 00:19:56,623
Now, to get the Warhammer
Titan's attention.

301
00:19:58,403 --> 00:20:02,153
[REINER] Pieck, please find
a way to hold out.

302
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:10,963
[REINER TITAN yells]

303
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,433
Now, Jean! Move it!

304
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:34,273
I won't be long.
Just hang on...

305
00:20:34,363 --> 00:20:36,743
...till I can reach
that detonator!

306
00:20:39,073 --> 00:20:41,033
[JEAN]
Agh! That's just our luck.

307
00:20:41,113 --> 00:20:43,783
Of course there'd be
even more of them!

308
00:20:46,243 --> 00:20:48,203
[PIECK screams]

309
00:20:48,293 --> 00:20:51,883
Could go for some ODM
gear myself right now!

310
00:20:57,883 --> 00:21:00,803
I can't get close
enough. Damn it!

311
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:08,393
Pieck! You need to run for it!

312
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:15,533
Jean, if you think that
the Cart is just a utility Titan

313
00:21:15,613 --> 00:21:19,453
that's not cut out for combat,
you're dead wrong!

314
00:21:21,209 --> 00:21:22,548
[PIECK]
With the Cart's endurance,

315
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,953
as long as I'm not
taken out myself,

316
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:27,823
I can transform
hundreds of times!

317
00:21:29,253 --> 00:21:32,343
[PIECK]
As many as it takes!

318
00:21:32,423 --> 00:21:33,633
So leave me be.

319
00:21:33,713 --> 00:21:36,633
You just focus on getting
to that detonator!

320
00:21:46,433 --> 00:21:48,813
Though hundreds of victories

321
00:21:48,893 --> 00:21:52,393
won't do me much good
against millions of enemies.

322
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:04,493
[ANNIE] They're even using
Bertholdt as a puppet.

323
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,113
How could they?

324
00:22:07,413 --> 00:22:08,753
There it is!

325
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:11,833
That one, the pig thing!
Or whatever it is.

326
00:22:11,858 --> 00:22:12,938
[ANNIE]
Which one?

327
00:22:12,963 --> 00:22:15,463
Right there!
The weird one! See it?

328
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:18,253
[ANNIE] Where? Which one
of the Nine Titans is it?

329
00:22:18,343 --> 00:22:20,763
[MIKASA]
Might be a Cart, or a Beast!

330
00:22:20,843 --> 00:22:22,223
Or maybe a Jaw?

331
00:22:22,303 --> 00:22:23,643
[ANNIE]
That's not helpful!

332
00:22:23,723 --> 00:22:25,603
Give me a serious
description, will you?

333
00:22:25,683 --> 00:22:26,933
I did!

334
00:22:27,013 --> 00:22:30,103
There! The Titan that
just started running away!

335
00:22:30,128 --> 00:22:32,088
[ANNIE]
That one? Isn't that an Okapi?

336
00:22:32,113 --> 00:22:33,783
[MIKASA]
What the hell's an Okapi?

337
00:22:33,808 --> 00:22:34,978
[ANNIE]
Go, Falco!

338
00:22:35,003 --> 00:22:36,918
We'll corner that Okapi
thing at the tailbone

339
00:22:36,943 --> 00:22:38,733
and get Armin back!

340
00:22:44,493 --> 00:22:45,623
Good luck, guys.

341
00:22:45,648 --> 00:22:47,298
I'll support you from
here with this gun!

342
00:22:47,323 --> 00:22:51,703
I doubt that thing'll do much
against Titans like these.

343
00:22:51,793 --> 00:22:55,423
[LEVI] Need to find Zeke.
Where could he be?

344
00:22:57,043 --> 00:23:00,793
[LEVI] Even if I do find him,
I'm dead weight right now.

345
00:23:00,883 --> 00:23:02,213
Dammit!

346
00:23:04,803 --> 00:23:06,803
[LEVI]
I followed him for years

347
00:23:06,893 --> 00:23:09,563
without ever botching
one of his orders.

348
00:23:09,643 --> 00:23:11,983
Except this last one.

349
00:23:12,063 --> 00:23:14,653
Why's it given me so much grief?

350
00:23:17,653 --> 00:23:20,243
[LEVI] Could be that we
already served our purpose

351
00:23:20,323 --> 00:23:23,073
a long time ago.

352
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:25,283
Maybe our mission ended

353
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:28,533
on the day those brats
set foot in the sea.

354
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:35,083
[LEVI] But is this what you
dedicated your hearts for?

355
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:38,373
Did you die so that others
could be trampled?

356
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,923
[LEVI]
No.

357
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:44,923
The dream you painted
of a world without Titans

358
00:23:45,013 --> 00:23:50,603
was absurdly idealistic--
a place of pure joy.

359
00:23:50,683 --> 00:23:56,393
It had to be... for it to
be worth what you gave.

360
00:23:56,483 --> 00:24:03,493
Erwin, I-I didn't choose you
and I don't regret that.

361
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:08,443
[LEVI] I'm entrusting
the future to someone

362
00:24:08,533 --> 00:24:11,873
with the same look in
his eyes as all of you.

363
00:24:19,123 --> 00:24:22,003
Conny! It went your way!

364
00:24:25,763 --> 00:24:27,893
Get back here!

365
00:24:31,683 --> 00:24:34,273
[ANNIE] No! It's running
back to the skull!

or we'll be too easy to kill!

373
00:25:29,823 --> 00:25:32,073
[MIKASA] The okapi's headed
towards Bertholdt!

374
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:34,293
Not good.

375
00:25:34,373 --> 00:25:35,963

[ARMIN] You're my body and
I'm telling you to move,

00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,143
so why won't you do it?

378
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:59,353
You have to move,
I'm begging you!

380
00:26:02,273 --> 00:26:06,613

Every last one of
them is gonna die!

I hate you. I hate you.

386

And I always have!

387
00:26:27,883 --> 00:26:30,933
Because you've never done
anything but betray me!

00:26:32,263 --> 00:26:34,553

we accepted...

The second life we were given...

391
00:26:36,853 --> 00:26:39,193
You haven't done a thing
with any of it!

392
00:26:39,263 --> 00:26:40,263
So get up.

393
00:26:40,353 --> 00:26:43,773
How dare you lie
here dead! Get up!

394
00:26:43,853 --> 00:26:46,983
Get your worthless

[ARMIN]
Sand.

400
00:28:42,683 --> 00:28:44,273
[ARMIN]
Wait, think.

401
00:28:44,353 --> 00:28:48,523
If I had already suffocated,
if I was already dead,

402
00:28:48,603 --> 00:28:51,153
I wouldn't be able to think.

403
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:56,523
This isn't a dream, or a hallucination,

404
00:28:56,613 --> 00:28:58,653
or the afterlife.

405
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:06,993
This place is real.
It's the world of the Paths.

406
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:14,043
I should be inside
a Titan's mouth right now,

407
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:18,093
so how do I know what's
happening to my friends?

408
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:20,923
Is it because, as Eldians,
all of us are connected

409
00:29:21,013 --> 00:29:23,223
through the Paths?

410
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:28,473
If that's true, there might be
something I can accomplish here.

411
00:29:28,563 --> 00:29:31,733
That's right. I need to think.

412
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:33,733
I need to think!

413
00:29:50,503 --> 00:29:52,709
Hello, Zeke.

414
00:30:01,223 --> 00:30:05,313
Come take a seat,
old friend of Eren's.

415
00:30:05,393 --> 00:30:08,603
I'm guessing you were
consumed by Ymir, too?

416
00:30:20,403 --> 00:30:23,056
[ZEKE]
For a long, long time,

417
00:30:23,448 --> 00:30:27,786
the universe was
a chaotic mess...

418
00:30:27,811 --> 00:30:31,873
of light and matter.

419
00:30:33,253 --> 00:30:36,003
[ZEKE] From that mess,
countless insignificant things

420
00:30:36,083 --> 00:30:38,713
came into and out of being.

421
00:30:38,803 --> 00:30:42,893
Till eventually
something survived.

422
00:30:45,933 --> 00:30:49,103
Something now known as "life."

423
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:54,103
Life survived for one reason:

424
00:30:54,193 --> 00:30:59,903
It had the ability to multiply,
to spread itself far and wide.

425
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:04,483
In order to multiply, life had
to continuously change its form

426
00:31:04,573 --> 00:31:07,163
to adapt to different
environments.

427
00:31:07,243 --> 00:31:10,163
It's why we are as we are now.

428
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:15,453
Constantly spawning, and
expanding, and grasping at more.

429
00:31:15,543 --> 00:31:20,093
The sole objective of
life is to multiply.

430
00:31:20,173 --> 00:31:26,473
Sand. Pepples. Water.
They don't seek to multiply.

431
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:30,973
Yet life will never stop
struggling to do so.

432
00:31:31,063 --> 00:31:34,443
Extinction runs counter
to the goal of multiplying,

433
00:31:34,523 --> 00:31:40,493
so to make us run from death,
life cursed us with fear.

434
00:31:40,573 --> 00:31:44,123
Like anyone, she did what she
could to escape the suffering

435
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:46,323
that fear brings.

436
00:31:46,403 --> 00:31:52,163
She created a stronger, larger,
seemingly immortal body,

437
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,993
and then she escaped
into a world

438
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:56,633
where death doesn't even exist.

439
00:31:56,713 --> 00:31:59,173
That's the truth
of the Founder Ymir,

440
00:31:59,253 --> 00:32:02,843
and this is the world
she escaped to.

441
00:32:02,923 --> 00:32:06,423
If that's the case, then
what's Ymir's objective now?

442
00:32:06,513 --> 00:32:08,553
What drives her?

443
00:32:08,643 --> 00:32:09,973
A good question.

444
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,473
I've spent a maddening
amount of time

445
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:15,363
trying to understand
the Founder.

446
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:18,733
She possessed power that
most have never dreamed of.

447
00:32:18,813 --> 00:32:22,613
Yet she still couldn't
defy King Fritz.

448
00:32:22,693 --> 00:32:27,033
What made her stay here
for 2,000 years

449
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:30,703
obeying that long dead man?

450
00:32:33,703 --> 00:32:35,123
Clearly, there was something

451
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:38,083
she couldn't let go of.

452
00:32:38,163 --> 00:32:43,793
Eren managed to figure out
what it was, while I failed.

453
00:32:43,883 --> 00:32:47,973
And so, Ymir sided with him.

454
00:32:48,053 --> 00:32:49,893
I need you to tell me.

455
00:32:49,973 --> 00:32:53,563
How might someone return to
the outside world from here?

456
00:32:53,643 --> 00:32:55,313
Who can say?

457
00:32:55,393 --> 00:32:58,183
Don't really think
it's possible, myself.

458
00:32:58,273 --> 00:33:02,573
Please, Zeke. I'm far
from ready to give up.

459
00:33:02,653 --> 00:33:04,073
And why is that?

460
00:33:04,153 --> 00:33:06,693
Uh, well, because I--

461
00:33:06,783 --> 00:33:10,333
You still seek to multiply? Why?

462
00:33:10,413 --> 00:33:14,963
Is continuing the species
really that important to you?

463
00:33:15,033 --> 00:33:18,533
One might say that all this
is just the tragic result

464
00:33:18,623 --> 00:33:21,043
of life's being ruled by fear.

465
00:33:21,123 --> 00:33:22,833
We face a calamity of fear,

466
00:33:22,923 --> 00:33:26,513
fed by the pointless
mechanics of life.

467
00:33:26,593 --> 00:33:28,933
My comrades are still
fighting out there!

468
00:33:29,013 --> 00:33:31,353
And we still have time
to save countless people

469
00:33:31,433 --> 00:33:33,063
from a terrifying end!

470
00:33:33,143 --> 00:33:36,273
People are fighting
fear as we speak!

471
00:33:36,353 --> 00:33:39,313
But would it be
so awful to lose?

472
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:43,943
We'll all face death in time.
Why fight so hard to delay it?

473
00:33:46,903 --> 00:33:48,363
As death comes,

474
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:52,993
I suspect that we might find
ourselves feeling relief.

475
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:56,073
No longer manipulated
by the body's urges,

476
00:33:56,163 --> 00:33:57,793
or driven to multiply
without knowing

477
00:33:57,873 --> 00:34:00,543
if any of this has a point.

478
00:34:00,623 --> 00:34:04,673
We may feel like
we've been set free.

479
00:34:08,053 --> 00:34:09,383
[ARMIN gasps]

480
00:34:14,553 --> 00:34:16,843
[ARMIN]
The sun was starting to set.

481
00:34:16,933 --> 00:34:19,393
And I was racing
Eren and Mikasa,

482
00:34:19,473 --> 00:34:23,473
racing to the tree on the hill.

483
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:26,863
Eren started running right
after suggesting the race.

484
00:34:26,943 --> 00:34:30,113
Mikasa deliberately
lagged behind him.

485
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:32,443
And I was last, of course.

486
00:34:32,533 --> 00:34:36,453
But the wind was
slightly warm that day,

487
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:40,163
and it felt good
just to be running.

488
00:34:40,253 --> 00:34:43,093
As the wind stirred
the dead leaves,

489
00:34:43,163 --> 00:34:47,503
this strange, lovely thought
popped into my head.

490
00:34:47,593 --> 00:34:50,263
I felt like maybe I'd been born

491
00:34:50,343 --> 00:34:53,683
to race Mikasa and
Eren up that hill.

492
00:34:56,763 --> 00:35:01,013
On rainy days, I would feel
the same way as I sat and read.

493
00:35:01,103 --> 00:35:04,653
I felt it one time as I was
feeding acorns to a squirrel.

494
00:35:04,733 --> 00:35:07,403
Even just strolling through
the market with my friends,

495
00:35:07,483 --> 00:35:09,653
I had this feeling

496
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:13,943
that those insignificant moments
were incredibly precious.

497
00:35:14,033 --> 00:35:15,453
Where'd you get that?

498
00:35:15,533 --> 00:35:19,873
Huh? I just found it
buried in the sand.

499
00:35:19,953 --> 00:35:22,623
But why would it be here?

500
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:24,033
Can't say.

501
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:26,503
But even though this
isn't useful to me,

502
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:30,213
even though I'm sure it'll
never help me to multiply,

503
00:35:30,303 --> 00:35:33,933
to me, it's a truly
precious thing.

504
00:35:35,263 --> 00:35:36,803

505
00:35:36,893 --> 00:35:39,233

That's right.

506
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:44,223
We would just throw the ball,
catch it, and throw it again.

507
00:35:44,313 --> 00:35:47,353
Over and over.

508
00:35:51,193 --> 00:35:56,033
There was no meaning behind it.
And yet it was just as you said.

509
00:35:56,113 --> 00:36:02,163
I would've been happy to go
on playing catch forever.

00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,693
[REINER]
Ymir!

523
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:17,773
[CONNY] D-Did Bertholdt
just save all our lives?

524
00:37:17,863 --> 00:37:19,283
I don't understand.

525
00:37:19,363 --> 00:37:22,993
But still, I won't let this
chance slip away!

526
00:37:29,543 --> 00:37:31,293
I made the shot!

527
00:37:36,133 --> 00:37:41,683
You've got my friend.
Give him back!

528
00:37:48,483 --> 00:37:49,653
Armin!

529
00:37:49,733 --> 00:37:53,153
[Yells]

530
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:00,863
Annie!

531
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:08,203
[ARMIN coughing]

532
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:10,913
[ARMIN]
Annie.

533
00:38:12,333 --> 00:38:14,463
Hey, Armin.

534
00:38:14,543 --> 00:38:17,753
Thanks, guys. And I'm sorry.

535
00:38:17,843 --> 00:38:21,593
But now,
I'm ready to fight.

536
00:38:21,673 --> 00:38:23,803
[CONNY]
Annie, behind you!

537
00:38:34,853 --> 00:38:36,393
[BOTH gasp]

538
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:37,563
[GABI]
What's going on?

539
00:38:37,653 --> 00:38:39,993
Some of those Titans
just switched sides!

540
00:38:40,073 --> 00:38:41,493
It sure looks that way.

541
00:38:41,573 --> 00:38:46,873
[ZEKE]
Hey! Levi!

542
00:38:46,953 --> 00:38:48,033
[Gasps]

543
00:38:48,123 --> 00:38:51,623
[ZEKE]
Over here!

544
00:38:51,703 --> 00:38:52,873
It can't be.

545
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:56,843
Missed me something awful,
eh, Levi? I know!

546
00:38:56,923 --> 00:39:00,883
I can't say that I've felt the
same about you though!

547
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:03,133
Zeke.

548
00:39:09,353 --> 00:39:11,143
What's happening
with these Titans?

549
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,103
It's actually all
thanks to Zeke.

550
00:39:13,183 --> 00:39:14,933
[MIKASA]
What did he do?

551
00:39:15,023 --> 00:39:17,863
[ARMIN] He awakened our comrades
in the world of the Paths

552
00:39:17,943 --> 00:39:20,943
where life and death
have no meaning.

553
00:39:21,033 --> 00:39:24,833
All Eldians are connected
by way of the Paths.

554
00:39:24,903 --> 00:39:28,573
That's probably because
the Founder Ymir

555
00:39:28,663 --> 00:39:31,413
is seeking connection.

556
00:39:31,493 --> 00:39:34,703
I think she wants
something from us.

557
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,463
[ARMIN]
Bertholdt.

558
00:39:42,843 --> 00:39:47,933
Mr. Ksaver, I failed to
turn our dream into reality.

559
00:39:48,013 --> 00:39:49,683
And I still know we were right.

560
00:39:49,763 --> 00:39:52,973
The euthanization plan would've
saved countless lives.

561
00:39:53,063 --> 00:39:54,853
That said...

562
00:39:54,933 --> 00:39:57,813
If it meant I could play catch
with you a little longer,

563
00:39:57,903 --> 00:40:03,573
I wouldn't mind
being born again.

564
00:40:03,653 --> 00:40:11,073
So thank you for giving me
this life at least, Father.

565
00:40:11,163 --> 00:40:14,873
I took it all. Every last
thing that mattered to you.

566
00:40:14,953 --> 00:40:20,503
I took your life, your power,
even your precious memories.

567
00:40:20,593 --> 00:40:21,883
Which is why,

568
00:40:21,963 --> 00:40:25,513
I already know that you
don't want to just stand by!

569
00:40:25,593 --> 00:40:26,843
All of you...

570
00:40:26,933 --> 00:40:29,433
[BOTH]
...please help us end this!

571
00:40:37,313 --> 00:40:40,983
[ZEKE]
What a beautiful day it is.

572
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:46,273
If only I'd had eyes for things
like this sooner, well...

573
00:40:46,363 --> 00:40:48,283
Considering all the
killing I've done,

574
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:51,153
that'd be too much to ask.

575
00:41:15,893 --> 00:41:19,813
The rumbling just stopped.
What's going on?

576
00:41:36,043 --> 00:41:38,173
[REINER TITAN yells]

577
00:41:38,253 --> 00:41:41,303
Now, Jean! Go!

578
00:41:50,059 --> 00:41:51,059
[JEAN yells]

579
00:41:51,093 --> 00:41:52,433
[PIECK TITAN]
Jean!

580
00:41:57,023 --> 00:41:58,273
[Gasps]

581
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:08,063
Eren, you damned...
suicidal maniac!

582
00:42:21,463 --> 00:42:23,253
[ANOMALY squeals]

583
00:42:27,803 --> 00:42:30,803
[JEAN] That thing--
it's after Eren's head!

584
00:42:35,238 --> 00:42:36,238
Reiner!

585
00:42:36,263 --> 00:42:37,433
[CONNY]
Jean! Pieck!

586
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:38,843
We're getting outta here!

587
00:42:38,933 --> 00:42:41,103
Armin's gonna blow
these bones to pieces!

588
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:43,433
He can't yet!
Reiner's down there!

589
00:42:43,523 --> 00:42:44,943
[PIECK]
I think he'll make it.

590
00:42:45,023 --> 00:42:46,563
The Armored should be
able to withstand

591
00:42:46,653 --> 00:42:48,493
the Colossal's explosion.

592
00:42:48,573 --> 00:42:51,243
And regardless,
to pass up this chance

593
00:42:51,323 --> 00:42:53,703
would be to trample
Reiner's resolve.

594
00:42:53,783 --> 00:42:56,743
[Yells]

595
00:42:59,373 --> 00:43:00,913
[ARMIN]
Thank you.

596
00:43:03,673 --> 00:43:06,173
[ARMIN]
If you hadn't risen to help us,

597
00:43:06,253 --> 00:43:09,293
then we never could've brought
an end to the rumbling.

598
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:20,853
[ARMIN]
Goodbye... Eren.

599
00:43:33,073 --> 00:43:35,703
[Inaudible]

600
00:43:47,173 --> 00:43:50,093
[GABI'S DAD] Karina!
You're not hurt, are you?

601
00:43:51,093 --> 00:43:52,933
What in the world just happened?

602
00:43:52,958 --> 00:43:54,398
[ELDIAN H]
That explosion was insane.

603
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:55,699
[ELDIAN I]
Did everyone make it?

604
00:43:55,752 --> 00:43:56,843
[FALCO'S DAD]
Over there!

605
00:44:00,603 --> 00:44:06,363
Look, the bones.
Does this mean Eren's dead?

606
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,103
[Grunts]

607
00:44:11,193 --> 00:44:13,573
[EREN] As an Ackermann
with awakened powers...

608
00:44:13,653 --> 00:44:15,493
I just couldn't stand
to look at a slave

609
00:44:15,573 --> 00:44:16,703
with no mind of her own...

610
00:44:16,783 --> 00:44:19,413
[MIKASA] That was the
last time we spoke?

611
00:44:19,493 --> 00:44:23,743
Ever since I was a kid,
I've hated you.

612
00:44:23,833 --> 00:44:26,253
[MIKASA]
That can't be.

613
00:44:31,753 --> 00:44:33,383
[Gasps]

614
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,883
[Inaudible]

615
00:44:45,063 --> 00:44:48,733
[CONNY] I won't claim
to have no regrets.

616
00:44:48,813 --> 00:44:52,773
But still, we definitely did
the right thing, didn't we?

617
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:55,913
I mean, we put an
end to the rumbling.

618
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:59,743
[ANNIE] They came here from
the internment zone. How?

619
00:44:59,823 --> 00:45:04,493
[KARINA] We were led here by
Mr. Leonhart, your father.

620
00:45:04,583 --> 00:45:06,753
Go and talk to him, dear.

621
00:45:09,463 --> 00:45:10,883
[ANNIE gasps]

622
00:45:13,843 --> 00:45:14,858
I see Armin.

623
00:45:14,883 --> 00:45:17,173
There any sign of Reiner?

624
00:45:25,933 --> 00:45:27,353
--[GABI] Reiner!
--[JEAN] He's okay!

625
00:45:27,433 --> 00:45:30,313
Whoa, what the--?
Look over there!

626
00:45:32,443 --> 00:45:35,363
It's still alive even after
getting hit by that explosion?

627
00:45:35,443 --> 00:45:37,943
Sure is. What the hell
is this thing?

628
00:45:38,033 --> 00:45:43,743
No clue. But I do know that
we can't leave it alive.

629
00:45:48,543 --> 00:45:50,583
[Gasps]

630
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,923
Ah. Well, that figures.

631
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:58,963
It only makes sense that he
would've survived as well.

632
00:45:59,053 --> 00:46:02,513
Yeah. But what do we do now?

633
00:46:04,763 --> 00:46:06,303
[MIKASA]
Eren.

634
00:46:12,983 --> 00:46:14,064
This is bad!

635
00:46:14,089 --> 00:46:16,243
If that glowing worm thing
finds its way back to Eren,

636
00:46:16,369 --> 00:46:17,863
the rumbling might start again!

637
00:46:17,943 --> 00:46:20,783
[CONNY]
Yeah. We gotta kill it somehow.

638
00:46:20,863 --> 00:46:22,823
If it survived that
explosion point-blank,

639
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:24,243
we can't kill it.

640
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:28,123
The one we should
target is Eren.

641
00:46:28,203 --> 00:46:29,833
You all get that, right?

642
00:46:29,913 --> 00:46:34,043
This nightmare won't end
until we take him down.

643
00:46:34,133 --> 00:46:37,513
Sorry, Dad, but I've
got one last job to do.

644
00:46:37,593 --> 00:46:39,263
I'm seeing this
through to the end

645
00:46:39,343 --> 00:46:42,303
'cause it's what Colt would do.

646
00:46:42,383 --> 00:46:46,893
[MIKASA] Why? Why did
it turn out this way?

647
00:46:53,483 --> 00:46:54,823
[Gasps]

648
00:46:59,443 --> 00:47:02,283
[MÜLLER]
Did you hurt your leg?

649
00:47:02,363 --> 00:47:06,283
[ANNIE'S DAD] No, it's been
like this. Thank you.

650
00:47:06,308 --> 00:47:07,822
[MARLEYAN SOLDIER C]
Lift him slowly.

651
00:47:07,847 --> 00:47:09,058
Bring the injured here.

652
00:47:09,083 --> 00:47:10,333
If you hadn't stepped up

653
00:47:10,413 --> 00:47:12,543
and emptied your gun into
the air when you did,

654
00:47:12,623 --> 00:47:16,623
I imagine we'd be at each
other's throats even now.

655
00:47:16,713 --> 00:47:19,173
I've made enough
mistakes in my time.

656
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:22,003
Let's work together
and overcome this.

657
00:47:22,028 --> 00:47:23,028
[ANNIE'S DAD]
Right.

658
00:47:23,053 --> 00:47:24,183
[ANNIE]
Dad!

659
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:29,843
A-Annie?

660
00:47:35,273 --> 00:47:38,363
[GABI] Why did that glowing
thing start spewing out gas?

661
00:47:38,443 --> 00:47:39,693
[MIKASA]
Did it die?

662
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:43,523
No. This isn't the
smell of a dead Titan.

663
00:47:43,613 --> 00:47:44,653
[Gasps]

664
00:47:44,743 --> 00:47:46,833
Could this be the same gas

665
00:47:46,913 --> 00:47:49,043
that they used
on Ragako Village?

666
00:47:49,123 --> 00:47:50,503
[Gasps]

667
00:47:50,583 --> 00:47:54,963
Mikasa! Pieck! Get on Falco!
We need to leave!

668
00:47:55,043 --> 00:47:57,133
I don't get it, what's going on?

669
00:47:57,213 --> 00:48:00,383
'Cause only Ackermanns and Titan
Wielders are immune, remember?

670
00:48:00,463 --> 00:48:02,343
You know what's coming
better than we do,

671
00:48:02,423 --> 00:48:05,133
so you know what needs doing!

672
00:48:05,223 --> 00:48:08,643
But that... that can't be.

673
00:48:08,723 --> 00:48:09,933
It's just too much.

674
00:48:10,013 --> 00:48:12,013
We have to go now!

675
00:48:16,023 --> 00:48:20,483
Wait, we can't! No! Dad! Dad!

676
00:48:24,113 --> 00:48:28,913
[Roars]

677
00:48:34,583 --> 00:48:37,003
[CONNY]
So this is how we go out.

678
00:48:38,083 --> 00:48:39,873
[JEAN]
Guess so.

679
00:48:39,963 --> 00:48:42,763
We'll entrust the rest
to our comrades.

680
00:48:42,843 --> 00:48:46,553
Just like all the Scouts
who came before us did.

681
00:48:46,633 --> 00:48:49,553
[CONNY]
Do you remember, Jean,

682
00:48:49,643 --> 00:48:52,183
the night we had to burn
all those bodies?

683
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:53,643
[JEAN]
Yeah.

684
00:48:53,723 --> 00:48:55,893
[CONNY]
Well, so you know,

685
00:48:55,983 --> 00:49:01,323
it's your fault that we got
stuck havin' to save humanity.

686
00:49:08,493 --> 00:49:09,573
[MARLEYAN SOLDIER A gasps]

687
00:49:10,453 --> 00:49:11,493
[MIKASA, PIECK gasp]

688
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:14,123
[REINER]
This is absurd. There's no way.

689
00:49:14,203 --> 00:49:17,663
This isn't happening,
it just can't be!

690
00:49:17,753 --> 00:49:20,713
[ONYANKOPON]
Hey. Hey! Annie!

691
00:49:20,793 --> 00:49:22,213
Are you all right?

692
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:24,673
What in the world's
going on right now?

693
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:26,253

[MARLEYAN SOLDIER F]
S-Secretary!

695
00:49:45,863 --> 00:49:47,743
[ANOMALY squeals]

696
00:49:56,043 --> 00:49:59,883
[REINER] So... you've
summoned up an army.

697
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:01,803
Well, I don't give a damn!

698
00:50:01,883 --> 00:50:05,183
I'm still not gonna
let you pass!

699
00:50:07,553 --> 00:50:12,143
You really do enjoy making
life hell, don't you, Eren?

700
00:50:12,223 --> 00:50:14,893
Fine. We'll do things your way.

701
00:50:14,973 --> 00:50:17,763
I'll see this
through to the end!

702
00:50:21,233 --> 00:50:26,243
[REINER TITAN roaring]

703
00:50:30,363 --> 00:50:34,493
[REINER]
Conny. Jean. Gabi!

704
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:38,663
No. Is that... Mom?

705
00:50:39,913 --> 00:50:42,253
[Roars]

706
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:46,333
[REINER]
Pieck! Annie!

707
00:50:46,423 --> 00:50:50,513
[ANNIE screams]

708
00:50:53,093 --> 00:50:57,393
[REINER] Damn it.
When will this torture end?

709
00:50:58,439 --> 00:50:59,439
[Yells]

710
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:02,853
[LEVI]
Mikasa? Pull it together!

711
00:51:02,943 --> 00:51:04,693
There's nobody else
who can kill Eren.

712
00:51:04,773 --> 00:51:06,653
It has to be us!

713
00:51:07,863 --> 00:51:11,113
[MIKASA]
It's too much.

714
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:13,533
I can't take it anymore.

715
00:51:13,613 --> 00:51:15,153
[Inaudible]

716
00:51:15,243 --> 00:51:19,413
[MIKASA]
I wanna go back.

717
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:23,873
I just want to go back home.

718
00:51:27,043 --> 00:51:30,003
[EREN]
Mikasa. Wake up.

719
00:51:32,133 --> 00:51:34,223
You'll catch a cold.

720
00:51:34,303 --> 00:51:36,433
Eren?

721
00:51:36,513 --> 00:51:42,273
Wait, I'm confused.
When did I fall asleep?

722
00:51:44,563 --> 00:51:46,273
[Thud]

723
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:50,563
Not sure, but you
must've been exhausted.

724
00:51:50,653 --> 00:51:55,413
[MIKASA] I feel like I just
woke from a really long dream.

725
00:51:55,493 --> 00:51:57,533
Well, it's nothing
to worry about now.

726
00:51:57,623 --> 00:51:59,463
We can take it easy today.

727
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:02,033
I caught some pretty
big fish, so--

728
00:52:02,123 --> 00:52:04,913
Uh. Mikasa?

729
00:52:05,003 --> 00:52:07,093
Why are you crying?

730
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,133
I don't know.

731
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:17,673
But I feel like this isn't
where I should be right now.

732
00:52:19,263 --> 00:52:23,103
There's nothing
we can do anymore.

733
00:52:23,183 --> 00:52:24,893
[MIKASA]
Huh?

734
00:52:24,983 --> 00:52:27,483
[EREN] On the day we ran
away and came here,

735
00:52:27,563 --> 00:52:30,773
we gave up our chance
to change things.

736
00:52:33,613 --> 00:52:36,113
Marley's war ended
two months ago,

737
00:52:36,203 --> 00:52:39,703
so the invasion of Paradis
should start pretty soon,

738
00:52:39,783 --> 00:52:43,283
and running is the
only way to survive.

739
00:52:43,373 --> 00:52:44,623
It's hard though.

740
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:47,873
I'm sure that Armin's been
desperate to find us.

741
00:52:48,923 --> 00:52:51,673
But there's no way
I could make Historia

742
00:52:51,753 --> 00:52:54,883
become part of that
hellish cycle of killing,

743
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:57,003
and I can't commit genocide
against everyone

744
00:52:57,093 --> 00:53:00,223
past the walls either.

745
00:53:00,303 --> 00:53:02,473
So let's leave

746
00:53:02,563 --> 00:53:05,983
and live out the four years
I've got left in peace.

747
00:53:06,063 --> 00:53:10,313
We'll find somewhere quiet.
Just you and me.

748
00:53:10,403 --> 00:53:15,413
That's what you said,
Mikasa. You wanted this.

749
00:53:18,533 --> 00:53:19,863
[MIKASA]
Yeah.

750
00:53:23,793 --> 00:53:25,383
[MIKASA]
Sorry.

751
00:53:25,453 --> 00:53:28,913
I know we promised not
to talk about that stuff.

752
00:53:30,003 --> 00:53:34,383
Do you mind making
another promise?

753
00:53:34,463 --> 00:53:39,343
Once I'm dead and gone,
please throw this scarf away.

754
00:53:39,433 --> 00:53:44,313
You're gonna live without
me for a long time.

755
00:53:44,393 --> 00:53:49,443
So forget you knew me.
Forget, and be free.

756
00:53:54,403 --> 00:53:59,613
[EREN]
Please, Mikasa. Forget about me.

757
00:54:21,053 --> 00:54:22,973
[MIKASA]
I'm sorry.

758
00:54:25,183 --> 00:54:26,763
[MIKASA]
I can't.

759
00:54:28,523 --> 00:54:30,733
[MIKASA]
Eren's inside the mouth!

760
00:54:31,773 --> 00:54:34,573
Everyone! Help me reach him!

761
00:54:34,653 --> 00:54:36,743
[LEVI]
Understood, Mikasa!

762
00:54:38,993 --> 00:54:41,243
Eren!

763
00:54:59,383 --> 00:55:01,343
[Yells]

764
00:55:48,853 --> 00:55:53,103
I'll see you later, Eren.

765
00:56:27,553 --> 00:56:29,593
I understand that you
only did it for the sake

766
00:56:29,683 --> 00:56:32,983
of the future you saw with
the Attack Titan's ability,

767
00:56:33,008 --> 00:56:34,368
but I'm having trouble believing

768
00:56:34,393 --> 00:56:37,313
that you had to beat me
till I was spitting blood.

769
00:56:37,403 --> 00:56:40,903
Like, was that knee
to the gut necessary?

770
00:56:40,983 --> 00:56:44,153
I was doing everything I
could to push you two away.

771
00:56:44,243 --> 00:56:48,453
It seemed kinda crazy to me,
too, even as I was doing it.

772
00:56:48,533 --> 00:56:52,663
But I just let the
moment take over.

773
00:56:52,743 --> 00:56:54,533
I'm really sorry.

774
00:56:54,623 --> 00:56:57,503
[ARMIN] Don't apologize to me.
Apologize to Mikasa.

775
00:56:57,583 --> 00:57:00,713
She's the one you hurt
with your bullshit.

776
00:57:00,793 --> 00:57:04,543
Ugh. Yeah, you're right.

777
00:57:05,633 --> 00:57:08,553
So you did all that
to push us away, huh?

778
00:57:08,643 --> 00:57:11,273
To make us turn against you
and become the heroes

779
00:57:11,353 --> 00:57:14,943
who prevent the annihilation of
the human race by killing you.

780
00:57:15,023 --> 00:57:16,403
You got it.

781
00:57:16,483 --> 00:57:18,613
Every human left in the
world outside the walls

782
00:57:18,693 --> 00:57:20,863
will owe you a debt
of gratitude.

783
00:57:20,888 --> 00:57:22,378
You'll be known as
the Island Devils

784
00:57:22,403 --> 00:57:24,283
who stood against
your own homeland

785
00:57:24,363 --> 00:57:27,573
in order to save humanity.

786
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:29,153
I'm pretty sure it'll make you

787
00:57:29,243 --> 00:57:31,743
the most respected
people in the world.

788
00:57:31,833 --> 00:57:35,583
So you're hoping we can all
become like the Tybur family.

789
00:57:35,608 --> 00:57:37,018
You hope we'll have
enough influence

790
00:57:37,043 --> 00:57:39,673
to protect Paradis
from reprisal.

791
00:57:42,133 --> 00:57:45,803
Well, we're not heroes,
and we won't pretend to be.

792
00:57:45,883 --> 00:57:49,763
Sorry, Eren, hate to disappoint,
but after what you pulled,

793
00:57:49,843 --> 00:57:52,593
don't assume we'll
"hop to" for you.

794
00:57:55,183 --> 00:57:56,433
[ARMIN]
Where you going?

795
00:57:56,523 --> 00:57:59,113
To the places we always
dreamed about seeing.

796
00:57:59,193 --> 00:58:04,283
As we walk, I'll tell you more
about what happened with Ymir.

797
00:58:13,413 --> 00:58:16,753
[BOTH gasp]

798
00:58:16,833 --> 00:58:20,673
[EREN] So this is fire
that flows like water.

799
00:58:20,753 --> 00:58:25,213
[ARMIN] It really is.
It's even formed into rivers.

800
00:58:30,013 --> 00:58:32,263
Anyway, where did I leave off?

801
00:58:32,343 --> 00:58:34,053
You were saying the Founder Ymir

802
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:37,103
has continued to obey King
Fritz for 2,000 years.

803
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:40,103
You said that's why the Power
of the Titans still exists.

804
00:58:40,193 --> 00:58:41,323
Right.

805
00:58:41,393 --> 00:58:43,433
He burned her home down,
killed her parents,

806
00:58:43,523 --> 00:58:45,613
and ripped out her
tongue, to boot.

807
00:58:45,693 --> 00:58:48,903
And yet, even after
attaining godlike power,

808
00:58:48,993 --> 00:58:50,913
she went on serving him.

809
00:58:50,993 --> 00:58:51,993
[ARMIN]
Why?

810
00:58:52,073 --> 00:58:54,913
What could've compelled
her to do that?

811
00:58:54,993 --> 00:58:58,833
When I touched her in the
Paths, I felt the answer.

812
00:58:58,913 --> 00:59:01,753
Hard to believe as it may seem.

813
00:59:01,833 --> 00:59:06,753
The Founder Ymir...
she loved King Fritz.

814
00:59:07,139 --> 00:59:08,153
[ARMIN gasps]

815
00:59:08,254 --> 00:59:09,383
There it is.

816
00:59:09,463 --> 00:59:13,593
That's what kept her bound to
him as 2,000 years went past.

817
00:59:16,763 --> 00:59:18,553
[EREN] I'm a long way
from understanding

818
00:59:18,643 --> 00:59:22,233
what's in the depths
of Ymir's heart.

819
00:59:22,313 --> 00:59:25,523
But she'd clearly
been suffering

820
00:59:25,613 --> 00:59:28,703
through every one
of those years.

821
00:59:28,783 --> 00:59:32,373
She spent them seeking the
person who would release her.

822
00:59:32,453 --> 00:59:35,623
Then, that person appeared.

823
00:59:35,703 --> 00:59:37,663
And it was Mikasa.

824
00:59:41,333 --> 00:59:43,293
[ARMIN]
Huh? Did you say "Mikasa"?

825
00:59:43,373 --> 00:59:44,583
[EREN]
Sure did.

826
00:59:44,673 --> 00:59:46,003
You're not drifting
off, are you?

827
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:48,793
[ARMIN]
Of course I'm not!

828
00:59:48,883 --> 00:59:51,803
But tell me, why Mikasa?

829
00:59:51,883 --> 00:59:53,473
Not sure.

830
00:59:53,553 --> 00:59:57,053
To find out, you'd have
to ask Ymir herself.

831
00:59:57,143 --> 01:00:02,103
Honestly, not even I know
what Mikasa will do.

832
01:00:02,183 --> 01:00:04,523
The only thing I know for a fact

833
01:00:04,603 --> 01:00:07,523
is the outcome of
Mikasa's choice.

834
01:00:07,613 --> 01:00:10,993
It's what I keep moving
forward to reach.

835
01:00:12,363 --> 01:00:14,493
I slaughter most of humanity

836
01:00:14,573 --> 01:00:17,163
and trigger a civil
war in Paradis.

837
01:00:17,243 --> 01:00:21,293
What's more, I give my
best friends no choice

838
01:00:21,373 --> 01:00:24,253
except to face me and
the Founder in battle.

839
01:00:24,333 --> 01:00:26,923
I've got no clue if they live.

840
01:00:27,963 --> 01:00:31,593
So that's the future you
saw at the medal ceremony.

841
01:00:31,673 --> 01:00:33,843
Yeah, but...

842
01:00:33,923 --> 01:00:37,223
Ever since I obtained the
power of the Founding Titan,

843
01:00:37,303 --> 01:00:40,053
my head has become
a complete mess.

844
01:00:40,143 --> 01:00:44,143
The past and future--
it's all happening at once.

845
01:00:44,233 --> 01:00:47,823
And so, I had no choice.

846
01:00:47,903 --> 01:00:50,493
That day, in that moment,

847
01:00:50,573 --> 01:00:54,413
Bertholdt would've died,
but he had to live.

848
01:00:54,493 --> 01:00:55,663
[Gasps]

849
01:00:55,743 --> 01:00:56,873
[EREN]
So I...

850
01:00:56,953 --> 01:01:01,713
So I sent it away from
him and towards Mom.

851
01:01:05,003 --> 01:01:07,633
Let's go, Eren.

852
01:01:09,793 --> 01:01:11,713
Okay.

853
01:01:14,513 --> 01:01:17,763
All right, so how did
things go with her?

854
01:01:17,788 --> 01:01:18,818
With her?

855
01:01:18,843 --> 01:01:20,843
I mean with Mikasa.

856
01:01:20,933 --> 01:01:23,273
Do you really think she's
gonna be able to forget you

857
01:01:23,353 --> 01:01:25,483
and live happily with
somebody else?

858
01:01:25,563 --> 01:01:27,523
That's what you're hoping
she'll do, right?

859
01:01:27,603 --> 01:01:30,563
Uh, I don't know.

860
01:01:36,573 --> 01:01:37,573
[EREN]
Ow.

861
01:01:37,598 --> 01:01:39,048
The hell kind of answer is that?

862
01:01:39,073 --> 01:01:40,953
Listen, I still
haven't forgiven you!

863
01:01:40,978 --> 01:01:42,218
Just who do you think you are

864
01:01:42,243 --> 01:01:44,533
to disregard Mikasa's
feelings like that?!

865
01:01:44,623 --> 01:01:48,003
She always valued you over
everything, even her own life!

866
01:01:48,083 --> 01:01:50,253
You really think you could
just say, "Forget about me,"

867
01:01:50,333 --> 01:01:52,293
and that'd be the end of it?

868
01:01:53,753 --> 01:01:55,383
You're a selfish heartbreaker.

869
01:01:55,463 --> 01:01:57,053
And I hope she does
forget about you

870
01:01:57,133 --> 01:01:59,053
because she deserves
to be happy.

871
01:01:59,133 --> 01:02:00,593
But, hey, the good news is,

872
01:02:00,683 --> 01:02:02,273
I know of one
charming young fella

873
01:02:02,353 --> 01:02:05,693
she's pretty close to already!

874
01:02:05,773 --> 01:02:09,153
[EREN]
No. That'd break my heart.

875
01:02:09,233 --> 01:02:11,573
I don't want her to
find someone else!

876
01:02:11,653 --> 01:02:13,993
I wanna be her one
and only love!

877
01:02:14,073 --> 01:02:16,113
Even if she does get over me,

878
01:02:16,193 --> 01:02:19,653
I think it should take
her ten years at least!

879
01:02:21,163 --> 01:02:23,413
[ARMIN]
Oh. I see.

880
01:02:23,493 --> 01:02:27,833
Sorry, I-I didn't think you'd
say something that pathetic.

881
01:02:27,913 --> 01:02:31,043
[EREN]
Don't tell Mikasa about this.

882
01:02:31,123 --> 01:02:34,333
I want her to find
happiness. I do.

883
01:02:34,423 --> 01:02:35,803
But I...

884
01:02:38,923 --> 01:02:40,923
[EREN]
Damn it.

885
01:02:41,013 --> 01:02:43,433
I don't wanna die.

886
01:02:43,513 --> 01:02:48,223
I just want to stay with
Mikasa. With all of you.

887
01:02:48,313 --> 01:02:50,603
[ARMIN]
Eren! We don't have to give up.

888
01:02:50,693 --> 01:02:51,903
We can find another way!

889
01:02:51,983 --> 01:02:53,363
We can't!

890
01:02:53,443 --> 01:02:56,493
I'm sure all the people I
crushed wanted to live, too.

891
01:02:56,573 --> 01:03:00,373
And yet... I--

892
01:03:10,713 --> 01:03:13,003
[EREN]
Eighty percent.

893
01:03:13,083 --> 01:03:14,373
Huh?

894
01:03:14,463 --> 01:03:18,133
I end up killing
80% of humanity.

895
01:03:20,723 --> 01:03:24,473
No. How could you?!

896
01:03:24,553 --> 01:03:27,353
Why? Eren!

897
01:03:27,433 --> 01:03:29,603
I know that I try to eradicate

898
01:03:29,683 --> 01:03:32,353
all of humanity
outside the walls.

899
01:03:32,443 --> 01:03:34,613
And by the time I'm killed...

900
01:03:34,693 --> 01:03:37,863
...four in five people are
dead and the greater world

901
01:03:37,943 --> 01:03:40,073
is reduced to the
level of civilization

902
01:03:40,153 --> 01:03:42,033
that we have in Paradis.

903
01:03:42,113 --> 01:03:45,863
Meaning, there won't be a
one-sided war of reprisal

904
01:03:45,953 --> 01:03:47,413
like you feared.

905
01:03:47,493 --> 01:03:51,163
Though this conflict
doesn't end.

906
01:03:51,253 --> 01:03:53,003
[ARMIN]
What the hell do you mean?

907
01:03:53,083 --> 01:03:55,543
Are you telling me that
all of this is pointless?

908
01:03:55,633 --> 01:03:59,883
The massacre hasn't even
happened yet! Just stop it!

909
01:03:59,963 --> 01:04:01,803
[EREN]
I can't.

910
01:04:01,883 --> 01:04:05,933
Twenty percent of humanity is as
much as you can manage to save.

911
01:04:06,013 --> 01:04:08,763
It's been determined.

912
01:04:08,853 --> 01:04:10,483
"Been determined"?

913
01:04:10,563 --> 01:04:14,233
But you determined it!
You're the one who kills them!

914
01:04:14,313 --> 01:04:17,363
I can't tell you how many
times I tried and failed

915
01:04:17,443 --> 01:04:19,283
to change what comes to pass.

916
01:04:19,363 --> 01:04:22,073
But things always turn
out exactly as I saw

917
01:04:22,153 --> 01:04:25,113
in all my memories
of the future.

918
01:04:25,203 --> 01:04:28,873
You were right.
I'm not free, Armin.

919
01:04:28,953 --> 01:04:32,953
I'm a slave to freedom.

920
01:04:35,373 --> 01:04:39,213
No. None of this makes
any damn sense!

921
01:04:39,293 --> 01:04:42,923
So... it hasn't happened,
but it can't be undone?

922
01:04:43,013 --> 01:04:45,223
Do you know how completely
deranged this is?

923
01:04:45,303 --> 01:04:47,933
It isn't a solution,
it's another nightmare!

924
01:04:48,013 --> 01:04:50,763
What, you can't have
war if everyone's dead?

925
01:04:50,853 --> 01:04:54,443
How could someone see that
as more than a bad joke?

926
01:04:54,523 --> 01:04:58,023
Eren, there may be no end
in sight for this conflict,

927
01:04:58,103 --> 01:05:00,563
and I'm sure history
is full of people

928
01:05:00,653 --> 01:05:05,323
going through the same hell
we did, over and over.

929
01:05:05,403 --> 01:05:10,573
But we still need to believe
that on some distant day

930
01:05:10,663 --> 01:05:12,793
we can all understand
each other.

931
01:05:12,873 --> 01:05:17,673
And now, that fragile
hope is just... gone.

932
01:05:17,753 --> 01:05:20,883
You trampled it, Eren.

933
01:05:20,963 --> 01:05:24,553
The only lesson left
is "kill or be killed."

934
01:05:24,633 --> 01:05:26,173
That's it.

935
01:05:28,343 --> 01:05:34,103
And you're trying to say
that you did this for us?

936
01:05:34,183 --> 01:05:37,603
[GRISHA] Eren. That's the
name we picked for you.

937
01:05:37,693 --> 01:05:40,943
No, that's... that's not true.

938
01:05:41,023 --> 01:05:42,403
Yeah.

939
01:05:42,483 --> 01:05:46,403
And, Eren, you're free.

940
01:05:49,993 --> 01:05:54,163
I flattened the world
because I wanted to.

941
01:05:55,833 --> 01:05:59,503
Because I wanted
to see this sight.

942
01:05:59,583 --> 01:06:01,583
[ARMIN]
Why?

943
01:06:01,673 --> 01:06:03,593
I don't actually know why.

944
01:06:03,673 --> 01:06:08,633
I just know that I
wanted it so very badly.

945
01:06:11,853 --> 01:06:14,143
Of course, I told myself
that I was doing it

946
01:06:14,223 --> 01:06:15,893
to protect all of you.

947
01:06:15,973 --> 01:06:20,063
But Sasha and Hange both died
'cause of my actions.

948
01:06:20,153 --> 01:06:22,073
And I'm the one who put
all of you and Floch

949
01:06:22,153 --> 01:06:25,033
at each others throats.

950
01:06:25,113 --> 01:06:29,413
Why? Why did it
turn out this way?

951
01:06:29,493 --> 01:06:32,333
I finally know.

952
01:06:32,413 --> 01:06:34,833
Because I'm an idiot.

953
01:06:34,913 --> 01:06:37,333
I'm nothing more than
a garden-variety idiot

954
01:06:37,413 --> 01:06:40,083
who got his hands on power.

955
01:06:40,173 --> 01:06:43,973
That's why this is the only
resolution I can bring about.

956
01:06:44,043 --> 01:06:47,543
Heh. That's all there is to it.

957
01:06:59,643 --> 01:07:01,683
[ARMIN]
I get it.

958
01:07:01,773 --> 01:07:03,903
I get why you wanted
to erase humanity

959
01:07:03,983 --> 01:07:05,903
from the world beyond the walls.

960
01:07:05,983 --> 01:07:08,023
I've felt the same.

961
01:07:08,943 --> 01:07:11,283
You liar. You would never
stoop to something so--

962
01:07:11,363 --> 01:07:13,323
[ARMIN]
Nobody will ever guess it

963
01:07:13,413 --> 01:07:16,663
since I'm a hero who saved
20% of all people.

964
01:07:16,743 --> 01:07:18,993
But still, it was me
who showed you the book

965
01:07:19,083 --> 01:07:21,583
that formed the basis
for your worldview.

966
01:07:21,663 --> 01:07:23,043
That dumb idea--

967
01:07:23,123 --> 01:07:26,373
of a free, unoccupied world
waiting to be conquered--

968
01:07:26,463 --> 01:07:28,633
was mine.

969
01:07:28,713 --> 01:07:30,003
What is that?

970
01:07:30,093 --> 01:07:32,433
I'm glad that you finally
noticed it, Eren.

971
01:07:32,513 --> 01:07:35,393
It's been right here at
our feet this whole time,

972
01:07:35,473 --> 01:07:39,773
but you were always looking
off into the distance.

973
01:07:39,853 --> 01:07:42,193
Thank you, Eren.

974
01:07:42,273 --> 01:07:44,943
For showing me what
was beyond the walls.

975
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:47,483
And for showing me this sight.

976
01:07:47,573 --> 01:07:50,373
Both of us are responsible
for what happened.

977
01:07:50,443 --> 01:07:56,073
So, yeah, I figure in the end,
I'll, well, be joining you.

978
01:07:56,163 --> 01:07:59,043
You're joining me? Where?

979
01:07:59,123 --> 01:08:02,163
Assuming it exists, in hell.

980
01:08:02,253 --> 01:08:03,583
We'll spend eternity suffering

981
01:08:03,673 --> 01:08:06,763
for every single
life that we stole.

982
01:08:06,843 --> 01:08:08,343
Together.

983
01:08:18,223 --> 01:08:20,393
I have to let you go now.

984
01:08:20,473 --> 01:08:22,973
I'm erasing your memory
of our time here.

985
01:08:23,063 --> 01:08:26,313
But when our next meeting ends,
it'll all come back to you.

986
01:08:26,403 --> 01:08:30,323
Yeah, 'cause it'll
end with you dead.

987
01:08:30,403 --> 01:08:33,573
And when we meet
again after that...

988
01:08:33,653 --> 01:08:40,203
[EREN] Yeah. Look for me
in hell. I'll be waiting.

989
01:08:40,293 --> 01:08:46,133
[ARMIN] Right. We'll be
together, for all time.

990
01:08:49,593 --> 01:08:51,933
[ANNIE]
So your wounds are all better?

991
01:08:53,383 --> 01:08:54,763
[ARMIN]
Annie?

992
01:08:56,133 --> 01:08:59,763
[ARMIN] Yeah, they've had
enough time to heal.

993
01:09:22,913 --> 01:09:26,873
It's all come back
to me. All of it.

994
01:09:26,963 --> 01:09:28,423
[MIKASA]
Armin.

995
01:09:34,963 --> 01:09:40,973
[ARMIN wails]

996
01:09:46,313 --> 01:09:49,563
You got your memories
back, too, right?

997
01:09:49,653 --> 01:09:53,363
Of the times Eren
reached out to talk to us?

998
01:09:53,443 --> 01:09:54,653
I did.

999
01:09:54,733 --> 01:09:58,443
He said that... that you
would make a choice,

1000
01:09:58,533 --> 01:10:00,873
and that in the end,

1001
01:10:00,953 --> 01:10:03,203
it would cause the
Power of the Titans

1002
01:10:03,283 --> 01:10:06,283
to be erased from this world.

1003
01:10:07,213 --> 01:10:09,303
He talked to me, too.

1004
01:10:09,373 --> 01:10:12,003
What a conscientious
piece of shit.

1005
01:10:12,093 --> 01:10:16,013
Eren... I can't believe you.

1006
01:10:16,093 --> 01:10:18,133
Listen to this.

1007
01:10:18,223 --> 01:10:22,723
Eren told me that my mom
would turn back into a human.

1008
01:10:22,803 --> 01:10:28,433
He told me that he hoped
we would all live long lives.

1009
01:10:28,523 --> 01:10:30,063
But what about you?

1010
01:10:30,153 --> 01:10:35,823
Why didn't you worry about
yourself? You suicidal maniac.

1011
01:10:35,903 --> 01:10:42,953
Wow. I'm feeling kinda left out.
Wish I'd gotten a chat.

1012
01:10:45,833 --> 01:10:48,543
Welcome home, Annie.

1013
01:10:48,623 --> 01:10:51,923
[ANNIE]
It's good to be back, Dad.

1014
01:10:52,003 --> 01:10:55,303
Gabi!

1015
01:10:57,383 --> 01:11:03,643
Well, look who showed up.
Were you watching?

1016
01:11:04,683 --> 01:11:07,893
It would seem that this is it.

1017
01:11:07,973 --> 01:11:12,603
This is what we did with
the hearts you gave.

1018
01:11:41,343 --> 01:11:43,133
[CONNY]
Sasha.

1019
01:11:45,806 --> 01:11:47,738
--[GABI] Mom! Dad!
--[GABI'S DAD] My sweet girl.

1020
01:11:47,763 --> 01:11:52,063
[FALCO]
Gabi! Hey!

1021
01:11:52,143 --> 01:11:54,273
[Gasps] Falco!

1022
01:12:00,493 --> 01:12:04,703
[REINER]
Mom, I, uh...

1023
01:12:04,783 --> 01:12:09,083
I don't think that I'm
the Armored Titan anymore.

1024
01:12:09,163 --> 01:12:13,083
[KARINA] Really?
That's wonderful, Riener.

1025
01:12:13,163 --> 01:12:18,123
I'm so sorry for
everything. All of it.

1026
01:12:18,213 --> 01:12:22,973
I finally see that you were
the only thing I ever needed.

1027
01:12:29,103 --> 01:12:31,443
[MIKASA]
I should go now.

1028
01:12:31,523 --> 01:12:33,653
Huh? Why?

1029
01:12:33,733 --> 01:12:37,233
Because if I were to stay
here, they'd take Eren.

1030
01:12:37,313 --> 01:12:40,903
And there's no way they'd
give him a good burial.

1031
01:12:40,983 --> 01:12:42,573
[ARMIN]
Good point.

1032
01:12:45,323 --> 01:12:49,953
We should let him rest
somewhere nice and quiet.

1033
01:12:55,963 --> 01:13:00,343
[MIKASA] Maybe the place where
we always found him napping.

1034
01:13:01,883 --> 01:13:04,513
I think that's a good spot.

1035
01:13:20,113 --> 01:13:22,953
[ANNIE'S DAD] Please,
Secretary Müller, listen.

1036
01:13:23,033 --> 01:13:25,073
Eren Jaeger is dead and gone,

1037
01:13:25,153 --> 01:13:28,533
and the Power of the Titans
was destroyed with him!

1038
01:13:28,623 --> 01:13:31,833
We're just people now.
Nothing more!

1039
01:13:31,913 --> 01:13:36,623
Can you prove that for
a fact? Here, and now?

1040
01:13:42,053 --> 01:13:43,683
If you took a blood
test, we could--

1041
01:13:43,763 --> 01:13:46,223
[MÜLLER]
I said here and now!

1042
01:13:46,303 --> 01:13:50,353
So please, find a way
to convince me...

1043
01:13:50,433 --> 01:13:54,353
...that you are humans,
not monsters.

1044
01:13:56,353 --> 01:13:59,483
If we still had the ability
to transform into Titans,

1045
01:13:59,563 --> 01:14:02,563
we'd be using it
to defend ourselves.

1046
01:14:02,653 --> 01:14:03,903
But, no.

1047
01:14:03,983 --> 01:14:06,443
Even as we stare down
the barrels of your guns,

1048
01:14:06,533 --> 01:14:08,163
we remain powerless.

1049
01:14:08,243 --> 01:14:12,043
There can be no greater
proof that we're human.

1050
01:14:12,123 --> 01:14:13,793
Who are you?

1051
01:14:15,663 --> 01:14:19,753
I'm an Eldian from Paradis.
My name is Armin Arlelt.

1052
01:14:19,833 --> 01:14:21,373
And I killed Eren Jaeger.

1053
01:14:21,463 --> 01:14:24,923
I stopped the Attack Titan,
and ended the rumbling.

1054
01:14:26,513 --> 01:14:28,803
It was you, wasn't it?

1055
01:14:28,883 --> 01:14:33,433
All this time, it was you...
peeking into my head.

1056
01:14:34,683 --> 01:14:39,313
Your life was stolen,
and your love was a nightmare.

1057
01:14:39,393 --> 01:14:44,483
None of the lives lost can
ever be brought back, but...

1058
01:14:44,573 --> 01:14:49,493
...it's because of the lives
you created that I'm here.

1059
01:14:58,293 --> 01:15:01,843
[MIKASA]
So rest in peace, Ymir.

1060
01:15:32,573 --> 01:15:34,283
[CHRISTA]
Three years after the so-called

1061
01:15:34,373 --> 01:15:37,623
"Battle of Heaven and Earth,"

1062
01:15:37,703 --> 01:15:41,503
there are still far more people
dead than left to mourn.

1063
01:15:41,583 --> 01:15:43,833
As for those who did survive,

1064
01:15:43,923 --> 01:15:47,383
they surely still suffer
from unhealed wounds.

1065
01:15:50,843 --> 01:15:53,643
[CHRISTA] As those battered
people try to rebuild,

1066
01:15:53,723 --> 01:15:56,353
their worst fears
are coming true.

1067
01:15:56,433 --> 01:15:58,773
Under Jaegerist rule,
the nation of Eldia

1068
01:15:58,853 --> 01:16:02,733
is rapidly building
its military strength.

1069
01:16:02,813 --> 01:16:05,443
Out of fear of reprisal from
the survivors of humanity

1070
01:16:05,523 --> 01:16:09,983
across the sea, the island
shouts with one voice:

1071
01:16:10,073 --> 01:16:14,573
"Kill or be killed.
Fight for your life.

1072
01:16:14,663 --> 01:16:17,623
The only way to
live is to fight.

1073
01:16:17,703 --> 01:16:21,833
So fight. Fight."

1074
01:16:21,913 --> 01:16:26,373
The end of Titans does not mean
the end to this conflict.

1075
01:16:26,463 --> 01:16:27,593
Eren made that clear

1076
01:16:27,673 --> 01:16:30,173
when he gave me his
knowledge of the future.

1077
01:16:30,263 --> 01:16:33,353
The future Eren showed
me is behind us now,

1078
01:16:33,423 --> 01:16:34,633
but his knowledge has left me

1079
01:16:34,723 --> 01:16:37,933
with a clear perspective
on these events.

1080
01:16:38,013 --> 01:16:40,263
I'm certain that this outcome
was not the result

1081
01:16:40,353 --> 01:16:42,313
of Eren's choices alone.

1082
01:16:42,393 --> 01:16:45,353
All of us add shape
and color to the world

1083
01:16:45,443 --> 01:16:48,363
with every choice we make.

1084
01:16:48,443 --> 01:16:51,073
Perhaps this
generation is cursed

1085
01:16:51,153 --> 01:16:53,823
to live lives
divorced from peace.

1086
01:16:53,903 --> 01:16:58,953
But if we must fight, let it
be for an end to fighting.

1087
01:16:59,033 --> 01:17:00,783
Eren feared that
this war would go on

1088
01:17:00,873 --> 01:17:03,873
until either Eldia
or the world was gone.

1089
01:17:03,963 --> 01:17:07,843
But in the end,
he left it in our hands.

1090
01:17:07,923 --> 01:17:12,183
Now, with this brief reprieve,
comes our chance to choose...

1091
01:17:12,263 --> 01:17:15,643
..."how to live in a world
without Titans."

1092
01:17:20,353 --> 01:17:22,603
Even Historia's
handwriting is beautiful.

1093
01:17:22,683 --> 01:17:25,773
I can't get over it.

1094
01:17:25,853 --> 01:17:26,933
Smells good, too.

1095
01:17:27,023 --> 01:17:28,483
[JEAN]
As I've said before,

1096
01:17:28,563 --> 01:17:31,023
you really shouldn't lust
after married women.

1097
01:17:31,048 --> 01:17:32,178
It's creepy.

1098
01:17:32,203 --> 01:17:33,968
I can't help but notice
that you're becoming

1099
01:17:33,993 --> 01:17:36,533
increasingly fixated
on your hair.

1100
01:17:36,613 --> 01:17:38,653
Just who are you
trying to impress?

1101
01:17:38,678 --> 01:17:40,048
The ladies who'll see my picture

1102
01:17:40,073 --> 01:17:41,908
when they're reading
history books.

1103
01:17:41,933 --> 01:17:43,308
They're gonna think
they're reading

1104
01:17:43,333 --> 01:17:45,083
the Field Guide to Horses.

1105
01:17:45,163 --> 01:17:47,913
[JEAN] You know, it's a real shame
your life got longer, Reiner.

1106
01:17:48,003 --> 01:17:49,133
Tch.

1107
01:17:49,213 --> 01:17:51,633
Paradis Island's in view now.

1108
01:17:52,923 --> 01:17:57,303
Hey, Armin. Do you seriously
think that this'll work?

1109
01:17:57,383 --> 01:18:00,513
We destroyed the walls.
You betrayed the island.

1110
01:18:00,603 --> 01:18:04,483
And we all helped kill Eren,
who these people revere.

1111
01:18:04,563 --> 01:18:08,773
Yet the Allied Forces sent us
to handle these peace talks?

1112
01:18:08,853 --> 01:18:10,853
Ambassadors or not,
I wouldn't be surprised

1113
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:13,653
if we got blown out of
the water pretty soon.

1114
01:18:13,733 --> 01:18:17,363
Yeah. I'm amazed it
hasn't happened already.

1115
01:18:17,453 --> 01:18:19,493
Well, this is what we get
for letting that dumbass

1116
01:18:19,573 --> 01:18:22,453
make us "international heroes."

1117
01:18:22,478 --> 01:18:24,858
Hah. So much for
"living long lives."

1118
01:18:24,883 --> 01:18:26,053
Come on, Annie.

1119
01:18:26,078 --> 01:18:27,438
Don't tell me you
got on this ship

1120
01:18:27,463 --> 01:18:29,503
expecting to go home alive.

1121
01:18:29,583 --> 01:18:32,333
No, but we're all hoping
that there's a chance.

1122
01:18:32,423 --> 01:18:35,883
I mean, none of us came here
to commit suicide, right?

1123
01:18:39,513 --> 01:18:43,763
Walking back into what might be
hell is the right thing to do.

1124
01:18:43,853 --> 01:18:46,443
And don't forget that
we're Scout Regiment.

1125
01:18:46,523 --> 01:18:49,403
We're a bunch of dreamers
who don't know when to quit.

1126
01:18:49,483 --> 01:18:51,153
But I was in the
Military Police.

1127
01:18:51,233 --> 01:18:54,403
Anyway, we won't
be killed at once.

1128
01:18:54,483 --> 01:18:56,233
'Cause when the people
of Paradis see us,

1129
01:18:56,323 --> 01:18:58,703
they'll want to know...

1130
01:18:58,783 --> 01:19:01,033
...what we have to say.

1131
01:19:19,473 --> 01:19:23,223
[ARMIN] After trying to kill
each other again and again,

1132
01:19:23,303 --> 01:19:28,473
we put down our weapons
and began to call for peace.

1133
01:19:47,293 --> 01:19:51,923
[ARMIN] They'll ask us, "Why?"
What did we see?

1134
01:20:01,673 --> 01:20:04,673
[ARMIN] And we'll tell
them the whole story.

1135
01:20:25,623 --> 01:20:30,213
[MIKASA] Eren, the others
are coming to visit soon.

1136
01:20:33,163 --> 01:20:34,833
Won't that be nice?
