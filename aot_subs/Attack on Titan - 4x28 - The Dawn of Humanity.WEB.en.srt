1
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:11,680
[MIKASA] Everyone keeps saying
Eren has changed.

2
00:00:11,760 --> 00:00:14,220
And I thought he had, too.

3
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:15,930
But...

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:20,020
I wonder if we've
all got it wrong.

5
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,450
[MIKASA]
It could be that he's always

6
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,750
been like this inside.

7
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,120
But if this is
the real Eren Jaeger...

8
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:46,460
...what did I see in him
that made me keep him so close?

9
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,150
{\an8}Can you believe there are really

10
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:05,070
{\an8}enough people outside the walls
to fill up such a gigantic city?

11
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,270
Try not to talk about the walls

12
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,440
in front of the
general public, Conny.

13
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:10,610
Ah, right. Sorry about that.

14
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,950
[SASHA] This is the world
beyond the walls.

15
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:14,990
We're finally here,
outside the walls

16
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,450
we've known our whole lives.

17
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,330
The walls no one
has ever escaped!

18
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,830
Gah, would you
listen to me for once?

19
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:24,210
If you think about it,
this is sort of

20
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:27,170
a return to the
Scouts' original mission.

21
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,390
[HANGE]
Let the survey begin.

22
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,280
Ahh.

23
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,910
{\an8}[ONYANKOPON]
My friends!

24
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:00,870
{\an8}I'd like to welcome you
to the continent of Marley!

25
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,460
{\an8}The Azumabito have been waiting.
May I escort you?

26
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,830
{\an8}Hey, Onyankopon!

27
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,250
{\an8}[ONYANKOPON laughs] It's so good
to see you all here!

28
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,800
{\an8}So, what does
everyone think about

29
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,760
the biggest port in the country?

30
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,180
[CONNY gasps]
What's with that horse?

31
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,390
Or, wait. Is that--
What was that?

32
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,680
Nah. No horse ever
looked like that.

33
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:20,930
I think it was a Marleyan cow!

34
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,430
[HANGE]
It must've been a car.

35
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,140
I've definitely
heard about those!

36
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:26,480
Hey! Car! Here, boy!

37
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,230
They're making a scene.
Everyone's staring!

[JEAN sighs] All these
people are gonna think

39
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:32,360
we're a bunch of yokels now.

Just act like
you don't know him.

42
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:38,740
[HANGE] Come back, car!
I promise I'll be nice!

43
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:40,620
Better get them on a leash.

44
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,950
They'll try and
feed the car carrots

45
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,500
if they manage to catch it.

46
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,540
[ONYANKOPON laughs]
Give him more credit than tha--

47
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,500
Wait, are they buying carrots?

48
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,340
{\an8}There are so many people here.

49
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,750
{\an8}Stay near me, Eren.

50
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,800
{\an8}We have no idea what to expect.

to be spacing out, Eren!

the outside world!

We really made it
across the sea, huh?

not to draw attention.

acting like overgrown kids.

It's ice cream, right?

[MIKASA]
Uh-- You know about it?

00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,750
I think I saw it somewhere
in Dad's memories.

90
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:52,330

[MIKASA] We didn't
recognize it at the time.

00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:08,220
Or maybe we refused to
let ourselves accept it.

from picking pockets.

With improvements in
blood testing technology,

143

countries are beginning to
discover that Subjects of Ymir

00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:25,570
have been able to sneak out
of the internment zones

145
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:28,530
and blend into
the wider population.

146
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,990
The bloodline of Ymir
made its way

147
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,120
across Eldian territory
when the empire was

148
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,370
at the height of its power,
and for many centuries,

149
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:36,040
the ability to
trace one's lineage

150
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,460
back to a Subject of Ymir

151
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,460
served as proof of noble status
among the global elite.

152
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,340
But as the Empire crumbled,

153
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,420
the aristocrats who'd
been aligned with Eldia

154
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,590
quickly found themselves exiled.

155
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:49,050
Today, you witnessed
the way Eldians are

156
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,430
typically treated
beyond the walls.

157
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,890
In light of that,
I'm sure you can see

158
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:56,270
how difficult it will be
to convince the world

159
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:00,350
to engage with the people of
Paradis on friendly terms.

160
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,730

Even so.

161

If we give up on pursuing
peace at this point,

162
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,030
our only remaining option
will be to throw in

163
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,280
with Zeke and his conspiracy.

164
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:14,160
We would be leaving
our fates entirely up to him

165
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,460
and sacrificing Historia's life,
and the lives of her children.

166
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,920
That's right.

167
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,040
We're looking for a way
to avoid such a future,

168
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:24,340
and our search
brought us to Marley.

It's possible.

hold a meeting with us,

179
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,490
they can help us get our
message out into the world.

You've come to

Yes.

have to try.

it's our duty to take it.

where the empire's
most loyal subjects fled

Well. I doubt
there's a connection.

It would have to be
some genetic illness,

333
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,960
but Mister Ksaver and
Marley's researchers

334
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,710
would have made note of that.

Our studies do indicate
the Ackermann bloodline

are triggered.

But this theory that she's
reflexively guarding her "host"?

340

To be honest, it seems
a little far-fetched to me.

than you're making it, Eren.

explanations

you're describing

00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:34,950
that have nothing to do with
genetics or conditioning.

345
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,490
She doesn't slaughter
Titans out of some

346
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,870
inborn compulsion
to keep you alive.

347
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:42,620
She does it because
she adores you.

348
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,290
Hey, Eren, listen.

349
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:50,210
[ZEKE] Well? What do you think
you're going to say to her?

350
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,340
That's not a serious
question, is it?

351
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,840
Even if everything goes right,

352
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,470
I've only got four
more years to live.

353
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:59,470
What would you think
about me having a child?

354
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:07,610
[EREN groaning]

355
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,320
[EREN groaning]

356
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:17,160
My life's end date is set,

357
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,870
but my friends will keep living
long after I'm gone.

358
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:24,000
[EREN groaning]

359
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,290
[EREN]
And that's what I want.

360
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,710
[EREN groaning]

361
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,340
[EREN]
What I need.

362
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:45,560
[EREN] For them to live
long, happy lives.

363
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:57,240
[ADMIRAL 87A]
An allied global fleet.

364
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:00,120
Nearly all of the largest
guns ever manufactured

365
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,540
have been gathered
from across the globe,

366
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:06,960
here, today,
off the coast of Marley.

367
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,540
The combined brainpower
of the world's nations

368
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:13,170
is focused entirely on
resolving this shared crisis.

369
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,300
It took nothing short
of a miracle to even

370
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,970
assemble a fleet
of this magnitude.

371
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:23,680
And by that miracle alone,
humanity still clings to hope.

372
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:31,860
[ADMIRAL 87A] For salvation
from this rumbling.

373
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:19,860
[Gasps]

374
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,100
[ADMIRAL 87A gasps]

375
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:39,070
[MARLEYAN SOLDIERS gasping]

376
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,580
[Gasps]

377
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,960
[MARLEYAN SOLDIER 87B]
Is that...? Yeah.

378
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:04,130
It could only be...
the Attack Titan!

379
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,800
[MARLEYAN SOLDIERS gasp]

380
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,360
[EREN]
I'll kill them all.

381
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,160
[EREN]
Every last one.

382
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:37,040
[EREN]
The world over.
