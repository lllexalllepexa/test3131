1
00:00:03,618 --> 00:00:07,334
I, uh, I keep having this dream.

2
00:00:07,418 --> 00:00:11,267
Where I see that guy from the
mountains who hung himself.

3
00:00:11,351 --> 00:00:13,468
He must've been planning to do it,

4
00:00:13,552 --> 00:00:16,934
so why did he tell us his story first?

5
00:00:17,018 --> 00:00:20,934
Couldn't say.
Doubt we'll ever know.

6
00:00:21,018 --> 00:00:23,934
He was probably hoping
that we'd forgive him,

7
00:00:24,018 --> 00:00:27,267
but after the way we abandoned Marcel,

8
00:00:27,351 --> 00:00:29,415
we were in no position to.

9
00:00:30,151 --> 00:00:33,668
I don't know if it
was forgiveness he was after.

10
00:00:33,752 --> 00:00:36,883
I couldn't really
tell you why, but I think

11
00:00:37,685 --> 00:00:40,482
he just wanted to be judged.

12
00:00:42,485 --> 00:00:46,849
Evening. It's been
four years, Reiner.

13
00:00:49,285 --> 00:00:51,734
Hey, uh... What's wrong?

14
00:00:51,818 --> 00:00:53,267
Mr. Kruger said
you were old friends

15
00:00:53,351 --> 00:00:55,601
and that he wanted to surprise you.

16
00:00:55,685 --> 00:00:58,334
It's true, right?
You two were friends?

17
00:00:58,418 --> 00:01:03,468
Yeah. And we have
a whole lot to catch up on.

18
00:01:03,552 --> 00:01:06,149
I don't even know where to start.

19
00:01:08,418 --> 00:01:09,849
It can't be.

20
00:01:11,485 --> 00:01:12,949
Eren.

21
00:02:58,968 --> 00:03:01,950
Lord Tybur. It's almost time.

22
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:03,950
Thank you.

23
00:03:04,033 --> 00:03:05,818
My goodness!

24
00:03:05,902 --> 00:03:08,950
Well, well! Lady Azumabito.

25
00:03:09,033 --> 00:03:10,617
Come to give me a pep talk?

26
00:03:10,701 --> 00:03:12,950
I'm sorry to interrupt your preparations.

27
00:03:13,033 --> 00:03:14,950
I just wanted to see your face.

28
00:03:15,033 --> 00:03:16,884
It must be a haunting sight.

29
00:03:16,968 --> 00:03:19,550
I seem to have a
bad case of stage-fright.

30
00:03:19,634 --> 00:03:23,283
Fear not. You look
courageous and dignified.

31
00:03:23,367 --> 00:03:25,550
You are a truly brave man.

32
00:03:25,634 --> 00:03:27,750
My family knows that well.

33
00:03:27,834 --> 00:03:29,950
I'll wish you luck and take my leave.

34
00:03:30,033 --> 00:03:32,665
I'm glad you came by.
Thanks, Kiyomi.

35
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:36,398
Sit down, Reiner.

36
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,884
I found us good seats.

37
00:03:39,968 --> 00:03:43,750
You can hear everything
that happens on stage.

38
00:03:43,834 --> 00:03:46,750
We're right beneath
an apartment building.

39
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:49,550
It's behind the stage, but still.

40
00:03:49,634 --> 00:03:53,484
It's full of excited families
waiting at their windows

41
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:55,598
for the curtains to rise.

42
00:03:56,834 --> 00:03:59,532
They're all directly above us.

43
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:02,818
Say, Mister Kruger.

44
00:04:02,902 --> 00:04:04,550
Did you cut your hand?

45
00:04:04,634 --> 00:04:07,632
Yeah. It's just a scratch.

46
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:12,198
Reiner. Sit.

47
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:19,818
So, uh, I think I should
head back to the others now.

48
00:04:19,902 --> 00:04:21,431
No, Falco.

49
00:04:22,634 --> 00:04:25,750
You should stay here and listen to us.

50
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:26,684
Huh?

51
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:30,432
Just... do as
he says, all right?

52
00:04:31,634 --> 00:04:32,699
'Kay.

53
00:04:33,834 --> 00:04:36,498
Now then. Let's get out of here.

54
00:04:41,634 --> 00:04:46,350
Hello. It's been quite
a while, Mr. Leonhart.

55
00:04:46,434 --> 00:04:47,949
Evening, Ms. Braun.

56
00:04:48,033 --> 00:04:51,265
I don't believe I've seen you
since your son came home.

57
00:04:52,634 --> 00:04:55,284
Speaking of which,
I hear Mr. Hoover died.

58
00:04:55,368 --> 00:04:56,750
In his sleep, I believe.

59
00:04:56,834 --> 00:04:59,350
He did. He always
used to speak of

60
00:04:59,434 --> 00:05:01,618
how proud he was of his son's courage.

61
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:04,750
How he gave his all for Marley.

62
00:05:04,834 --> 00:05:06,550
I'm sure that Annie was just as brave...

63
00:05:06,634 --> 00:05:07,898
She's not dead.

64
00:05:10,034 --> 00:05:11,750
My daughter is alive.

65
00:05:11,834 --> 00:05:13,350
One day she'll come back.

66
00:05:13,434 --> 00:05:15,398
She promised me she would.

67
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:20,550
To think.
We're about to declare war on

68
00:05:20,634 --> 00:05:23,832
what's left of Eldia from
the Eldian Internment Zone.

69
00:05:25,634 --> 00:05:28,550
Wow. Even General Calvi's here!

70
00:05:28,634 --> 00:05:29,883
Along with almost every other

71
00:05:29,967 --> 00:05:32,350
important Marleyan officer.

72
00:05:32,434 --> 00:05:35,550
The crowd's also full of
nobles and ambassadors.

73
00:05:35,634 --> 00:05:37,883
Not to mention
journalists from every newspaper

74
00:05:37,967 --> 00:05:40,350
in the world that's worth the ink.

75
00:05:40,434 --> 00:05:43,350
It kinda feels like we're the
center of the world, doesn't it?

76
00:05:43,434 --> 00:05:44,484
The Tyburs did this?

77
00:05:44,568 --> 00:05:46,350
Can't believe they're this powerful.

78
00:05:46,434 --> 00:05:49,365
Even though they're
just as Eldian as we are.

79
00:05:52,434 --> 00:05:53,950
I guess it's starting.

80
00:05:54,034 --> 00:05:57,550
Falco and Mr. Braun
haven't come back yet.

81
00:05:57,634 --> 00:05:59,750
Commander Magath sent me.

82
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,898
He needs his Eldian Warriors.

83
00:06:21,434 --> 00:06:22,950
Why, Eren...

84
00:06:23,034 --> 00:06:24,950
Why come here?

85
00:06:25,034 --> 00:06:27,165
What do you plan to do?

86
00:06:29,434 --> 00:06:31,750
The exact same thing you did.

87
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,550
No. I...

88
00:06:34,634 --> 00:06:38,750
As for why.
That's the same, too.

89
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,631
I don't have a choice.
That's why.

90
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:50,350
Sounds like the show's begun.

91
00:06:50,434 --> 00:06:51,798
We should listen.

92
00:06:54,434 --> 00:06:56,950
Let's pull back the veil of time.

93
00:06:57,034 --> 00:07:01,284
Roughly a century ago, the
Eldian Empire ruled the world

94
00:07:01,368 --> 00:07:03,565
through the might of its Titans.

95
00:07:05,834 --> 00:07:07,217
Humanity as we know it

96
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,883
could go extinct three times over,

97
00:07:09,967 --> 00:07:11,750
and the body count still wouldn't match

98
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,684
the number of lives
that Titans have stolen.

99
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,732
Such is the legacy of the founder, Ymir.

100
00:07:24,634 --> 00:07:26,550
So much has been lost.

101
00:07:26,634 --> 00:07:29,750
Countless peoples
and cultures, wiped out.

102
00:07:29,834 --> 00:07:32,684
Histories crushed
underfoot with their pride.

103
00:07:32,767 --> 00:07:35,750
Eldia's history is all we have left.

104
00:07:35,834 --> 00:07:38,284
And it tells only of killing.

105
00:07:38,368 --> 00:07:42,484
You see, once the Eldians
ran out of foes to conquer,

106
00:07:42,568 --> 00:07:46,132
they began to fight amongst
themselves, vying for power.

107
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:50,217
Thus began the Great Titan War,

108
00:07:50,301 --> 00:07:51,817
which saw eight of the Nine Titans

109
00:07:51,901 --> 00:07:54,883
locked in an endless cycle of bloodshed.

110
00:07:54,967 --> 00:07:56,883
But there was one brilliant Marleyan

111
00:07:56,967 --> 00:07:59,883
who saw in this chaos, a path to victory.

112
00:07:59,967 --> 00:08:03,484
He was the heroic paragon
we all know as Helos.

113
00:08:03,568 --> 00:08:05,484
Thanks to his cunning manipulations,

114
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:10,817
Eldian infighting grew far
worse, and the Empire grew weak.

115
00:08:10,901 --> 00:08:13,950
Then, Helos joined hands
with the Tybur family,

116
00:08:14,034 --> 00:08:16,750
and they forced the supposedly
unbeatable King Fritz

117
00:08:16,834 --> 00:08:19,431
to retreat to a far-flung island.

118
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:25,618
That said, he fled
with his powers intact,

119
00:08:25,701 --> 00:08:28,550
and his reign continued.

120
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:31,550
With him, he took tens
of millions of Titans,

121
00:08:31,634 --> 00:08:34,499
ready to trample the
world at his command.

122
00:08:35,701 --> 00:08:38,350
It's believed that our world

123
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:41,950
continues to exist unbroken
for one reason alone.

124
00:08:42,034 --> 00:08:43,683
Chance.

125
00:08:43,767 --> 00:08:47,284
Our scholars can field
no better explanation.

126
00:08:47,368 --> 00:08:49,350
In order to fight
this existential threat,

127
00:08:49,434 --> 00:08:52,550
my motherland, Marley, sent a
team of four Titan Warriors

128
00:08:52,634 --> 00:08:54,350
to take the Founder.

129
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:56,350
But they were soundly beaten,

130
00:08:56,434 --> 00:08:58,731
and only the Armored Titan returned.

131
00:09:00,034 --> 00:09:01,084
It's clear now.

132
00:09:01,168 --> 00:09:04,350
The ancient engine of cruelty
called the Eldian Empire

133
00:09:04,434 --> 00:09:06,950
is alive and well today.

134
00:09:07,034 --> 00:09:09,484
Honestly, it makes sense.

135
00:09:09,568 --> 00:09:13,350
I get why you plunged my home into hell.

136
00:09:13,434 --> 00:09:16,883
You were on a mission
to save the world, right?

137
00:09:16,967 --> 00:09:18,964
So you had to.

138
00:09:19,834 --> 00:09:22,683
My orders are to send
you to the gate, Jaeger.

139
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:24,350
All right.

140
00:09:24,434 --> 00:09:26,132
This way, you two.

141
00:09:29,834 --> 00:09:31,418
I feel like I've seen you before,

142
00:09:31,502 --> 00:09:33,418
but I can't quite place you.

143
00:09:33,502 --> 00:09:34,750
Where are you stationed?

144
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:36,550
My unit's out west, near Lakua.

145
00:09:36,633 --> 00:09:38,683
They sent me to help bolster security.

146
00:09:38,767 --> 00:09:40,484
I'm not interested in
chatting with an Eldian,

147
00:09:40,568 --> 00:09:42,284
even if you are a Warrior.

148
00:09:42,368 --> 00:09:43,950
Well isn't that a shame?

149
00:09:44,034 --> 00:09:46,683
I'd started to take a real
liking to your beard.

150
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:47,617
Oh!

151
00:09:47,701 --> 00:09:48,950
Pieck!

152
00:09:49,034 --> 00:09:50,884
It's the Panzer Unit!

153
00:09:50,968 --> 00:09:53,418
Thanks for all your hard work, guys!

154
00:09:53,502 --> 00:09:56,350
Oh, uh, honestly,
we should be thanking you.

155
00:09:56,434 --> 00:09:58,550
You're in a really good mood today.

156
00:09:58,633 --> 00:10:00,883
What are you doing? Let's go.

157
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:02,017
What was that?

158
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,950
What? Those soldiers ride
the Cart Titan into battle.

159
00:10:05,034 --> 00:10:07,950
I need their support, so I try
to build a bond with them.

160
00:10:08,034 --> 00:10:12,950
Well, no offense, but it seems
like ya did more harm than good.

161
00:10:13,034 --> 00:10:13,950
Hear anything?

162
00:10:14,034 --> 00:10:15,217
Nothing yet, sir.

163
00:10:15,301 --> 00:10:16,551
Everything's quiet for now.

164
00:10:16,634 --> 00:10:18,683
Report everything you hear to me.

165
00:10:18,767 --> 00:10:21,550
I don't care how
insignificant it may seem.

166
00:10:21,633 --> 00:10:22,731
Yes, sir.

167
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:25,698
In here. Go.

168
00:10:31,567 --> 00:10:33,418
So, where's Commander Magath?

169
00:10:33,502 --> 00:10:34,831
Porco!

170
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,817
Okay. What's going on here?

171
00:10:43,901 --> 00:10:46,564
Why does Vice Chief Braun seem so afraid?

172
00:10:47,301 --> 00:10:50,165
Mr. Kruger said they
were old friends, but...

173
00:10:52,633 --> 00:10:54,218
Old friends?

174
00:10:54,302 --> 00:10:56,950
Just how many years has he known him?

175
00:10:57,034 --> 00:11:00,299
If it's more than four, then...
they met on Paradis.

176
00:11:01,101 --> 00:11:04,218
Wait. That can't be right.

177
00:11:04,302 --> 00:11:07,284
Because... if it is...

178
00:11:07,368 --> 00:11:09,484
It can't be.

179
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:10,631
Oh no.

180
00:11:17,235 --> 00:11:19,683
The history I just recounted

181
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:22,284
to be common knowledge,
but I stand here now

182
00:11:22,368 --> 00:11:25,665
to inform you that it is
somewhat divorced from truth.

183
00:11:26,901 --> 00:11:29,351
I know this because the War Hammer

184
00:11:29,435 --> 00:11:33,017
isn't the only inheritance
the Tybur family bestows.

185
00:11:33,101 --> 00:11:35,484
We've passed down memories as well.

186
00:11:35,567 --> 00:11:39,217
Truths which I will now share with you.

187
00:11:39,301 --> 00:11:41,951
He's going off-script.
Not sure why.

188
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,284
...the Great
Titan War was ended,

189
00:11:44,368 --> 00:11:48,417
not by Helos, nor by my Tybur forebears.

190
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,417
The savior who ended the fighting,

191
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,683
the hero who saved the world,

192
00:11:52,767 --> 00:11:54,665
was King Fritz himself.

193
00:11:55,634 --> 00:11:56,951
He was plagued by guilt

194
00:11:57,035 --> 00:11:59,883
over the Eldian Empire's vicious past.

195
00:11:59,967 --> 00:12:02,483
He'd grown weary of watching
families and countrymen

196
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:03,683
torn apart by war,

197
00:12:03,767 --> 00:12:08,617
and he wept for Marley, a nation
under constant oppression.

198
00:12:08,701 --> 00:12:11,284
So when he inherited the Founding Titan,

199
00:12:11,368 --> 00:12:13,883
he plotted his own
downfall with the Tyburs.

200
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:16,750
Together, we created
a Marleyan hero who would

201
00:12:16,834 --> 00:12:21,284
drive the king out.
His name: Helos.

202
00:12:21,368 --> 00:12:22,683
After that, King Fritz moved

203
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:25,483
as many Eldians to Paradis as he could,

204
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:27,883
erecting his great walls around them.

205
00:12:27,967 --> 00:12:29,483
He left a warning.

206
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,351
That if anyone threatened his peace,

207
00:12:31,435 --> 00:12:34,617
countless Titans would be
unleashed in retaliation.

208
00:12:34,701 --> 00:12:38,831
However, he never intended
to make good on this threat.

209
00:12:39,567 --> 00:12:42,617
King Fritz made a vow renouncing war,

210
00:12:42,701 --> 00:12:46,418
and bound his successors
to uphold it just as he had.

211
00:12:46,501 --> 00:12:48,617
Thus, his ideology was passed down

212
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:51,217
to each new King of the Walls,

213
00:12:51,301 --> 00:12:53,483
and the Titans with the
power to crush the world

214
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:55,232
remained dormant.

215
00:12:56,035 --> 00:12:58,483
Marley didn't stop Eldia,

216
00:12:58,567 --> 00:13:01,683
and chance hasn't kept
the world from being crushed.

217
00:13:01,767 --> 00:13:04,683
It was the King of the Walls, Karl Fritz.

218
00:13:04,767 --> 00:13:06,865
A man who yearned for peace.

219
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,617
That's it. That's all he wanted.

220
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:14,217
He said that if Marley
grew strong someday,

221
00:13:14,301 --> 00:13:16,416
and came in force to shatter his peace

222
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,550
and seize the Founding Titan,
he would accept it.

223
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:23,883
He believed the sins his people
committed were so horrific

224
00:13:23,967 --> 00:13:26,951
that they could never be atoned for.

225
00:13:27,035 --> 00:13:29,217
"When the day of
retribution finally comes,

226
00:13:29,301 --> 00:13:32,617
I will accept it, but until then,

227
00:13:32,701 --> 00:13:36,550
let me enjoy this walled
paradise, free from strife.

228
00:13:36,634 --> 00:13:39,817
I ask for nothing but
a brief span of peace."

229
00:13:39,901 --> 00:13:42,431
Those were the final words
the King left us with.

230
00:13:43,767 --> 00:13:45,364
What does this mean?

231
00:13:46,501 --> 00:13:47,751
If what he's saying is true...

232
00:13:47,835 --> 00:13:51,417
So Marley and the Tybur family
didn't really save the world?

233
00:13:51,501 --> 00:13:53,617
Well, General? Your thoughts?

234
00:13:53,701 --> 00:13:55,417
But if the King of the Walls...

235
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,683
Willy wouldn't lie.

236
00:13:56,767 --> 00:13:57,817
...that
means Paradis doesn't actually

237
00:13:57,901 --> 00:14:00,017
pose a threat, right?

238
00:14:00,101 --> 00:14:02,883
It's true. To secure
our own safety,

239
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,217
my family joined hands with King Fritz.

240
00:14:05,301 --> 00:14:07,683
We became heroes to the world,

241
00:14:07,767 --> 00:14:10,417
while our fellow Eldians became devils.

242
00:14:10,501 --> 00:14:13,417
Put plainly, we Tyburs are petty thieves,

243
00:14:13,501 --> 00:14:16,617
growing fat on honor we did not earn.

244
00:14:16,701 --> 00:14:20,865
I stand before you, willingly
parting with my false glory.

245
00:14:21,701 --> 00:14:24,284
Because I have come to understand

246
00:14:24,367 --> 00:14:26,883
that the world we share
is in grave danger.

247
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:28,483
Commander!

248
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:30,683
The Warriors are gone,
and we haven't heard from

249
00:14:30,767 --> 00:14:33,017
any of the soldiers
we sent to collect them.

250
00:14:33,101 --> 00:14:35,417
Mobilize the reserves at once.
Track them down!

251
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:36,598
Yes, sir!

252
00:14:38,701 --> 00:14:40,431
Looks like it's begun.

253
00:14:42,101 --> 00:14:45,017
Shit. That really hurt.

254
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:47,417
What the hell is this place?

255
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:50,617
Looks like a pit meant
to detain Warriors like us.

256
00:14:50,701 --> 00:14:51,817
It's a classic.

257
00:14:51,901 --> 00:14:54,617
The space is too cramped to transform in,

258
00:14:54,701 --> 00:14:56,284
and with two of us down here...

259
00:14:56,367 --> 00:14:57,550
Hmm, got it.

260
00:14:57,634 --> 00:14:59,417
We'd just crush each other.

261
00:14:59,501 --> 00:15:01,017
I'm still confused though.

262
00:15:01,101 --> 00:15:02,617
What's that soldier's plan?

263
00:15:02,701 --> 00:15:04,417
Couldn't tell you.

264
00:15:04,501 --> 00:15:08,032
They really were familiar,
though. I know that much.

265
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:14,483
Please stay and watch.

266
00:15:14,567 --> 00:15:16,232
This is my atonement.

267
00:15:20,101 --> 00:15:23,751
With the Founder's might,
King Fritz erected three walls,

268
00:15:23,835 --> 00:15:26,817
using a great host of Colossal Titans.

269
00:15:26,901 --> 00:15:29,417
Counted together,
the walls surely contain

270
00:15:29,501 --> 00:15:32,017
tens of millions of Colossal Titans.

271
00:15:32,101 --> 00:15:36,683
They guard the king's peace
as his shield and his spear.

272
00:15:36,767 --> 00:15:41,483
Or they did, but now that peace
is being threatened from within.

273
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,483
An uprising has taken place on Paradis.

274
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:45,883
The King has been deposed.

275
00:15:45,967 --> 00:15:48,283
The Founding Titan: Stolen.

276
00:15:48,367 --> 00:15:51,683
The thief is an enemy to
every man, woman, and child

277
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:53,617
outside of his island.

278
00:15:53,701 --> 00:15:55,483
An enemy of peace.

279
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:58,798
His name... is Eren Jaeger!

280
00:16:01,701 --> 00:16:03,883
You tricked me.

281
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:07,483
After what you said, I respected you.

282
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:10,283
But you were just using me.

283
00:16:10,367 --> 00:16:12,683
Yeah, I was. I'm sorry.

284
00:16:12,767 --> 00:16:14,698
I did it 'cause I needed your help.

285
00:16:17,367 --> 00:16:18,350
The letters you had me send

286
00:16:18,434 --> 00:16:20,417
from outside the internment zone.

287
00:16:20,501 --> 00:16:21,564
Who were they to?

288
00:16:24,701 --> 00:16:28,417
I can't say the letters
made it to my family, but

289
00:16:28,501 --> 00:16:30,483
they reached my comrades.

290
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:35,283
But I... I didn't know.

291
00:16:35,367 --> 00:16:38,883
Wait. You wrote your comrades?

292
00:16:38,967 --> 00:16:41,350
If the Colossi of
Paradis are ordered to walk,

293
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:43,883
the rumbling will be
felt across the earth,

294
00:16:43,967 --> 00:16:45,751
and death will follow.

295
00:16:45,835 --> 00:16:48,283
Until now, only royalty has had the power

296
00:16:48,367 --> 00:16:49,751
to wield the Founding Titan,

297
00:16:49,835 --> 00:16:53,617
and King Fritz' vow has kept
his descendants from using it.

298
00:16:53,701 --> 00:16:56,683
But this Eren Jaeger
has found a way to use

299
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:59,283
the Founder without having royal blood.

300
00:16:59,367 --> 00:17:02,883
Which means he could begin
the rumbling at any moment.

301
00:17:02,967 --> 00:17:05,551
Once the walls of Paradis begin to walk,

302
00:17:05,635 --> 00:17:07,817
there will be nothing we can do

303
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:12,350
except flee in vain from
the sound of earthshaking steps

304
00:17:12,434 --> 00:17:14,350
that will herald our doom.

305
00:17:14,434 --> 00:17:16,417
These monsters will crush every city,

306
00:17:16,501 --> 00:17:18,817
trample every tree and flower.

307
00:17:18,901 --> 00:17:22,283
They will literally flatten our world.

308
00:17:22,367 --> 00:17:24,417
He's exactly right.

309
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,751
I'm the bad guy Willy says I am.

310
00:17:26,835 --> 00:17:28,817
If nobody stops me,

311
00:17:28,901 --> 00:17:32,283
there's a chance that
I'll destroy your whole world.

312
00:17:32,367 --> 00:17:37,017
But to my eyes, you looked
like the bad guys, too.

313
00:17:37,101 --> 00:17:40,483
That day, when you breached the wall.

314
00:17:40,567 --> 00:17:43,350
When Titans destroyed my home.

315
00:17:43,434 --> 00:17:45,764
When I watched as my mom was eaten.

316
00:17:47,301 --> 00:17:51,617
I couldn't
understand it. Why, Reiner?

317
00:17:51,701 --> 00:17:55,364
Tell me why my mom was eaten by a Titan.

318
00:17:56,035 --> 00:18:01,217
It's because we broke the wall
that was protecting her.

319
00:18:01,301 --> 00:18:03,532
Why did you break the wall?

320
00:18:04,968 --> 00:18:07,884
So we could use the chaos to sneak in,

321
00:18:07,968 --> 00:18:10,884
and to find out if the king would react.

322
00:18:10,968 --> 00:18:12,884
But what was your mission?

323
00:18:12,968 --> 00:18:16,683
To save the world by taking the Founder.

324
00:18:16,767 --> 00:18:18,551
Well that's that.

325
00:18:18,635 --> 00:18:21,617
If all that was to save the world, then

326
00:18:21,701 --> 00:18:23,799
you didn't have much choice.

327
00:18:27,501 --> 00:18:29,884
I remember what you said.

328
00:18:29,968 --> 00:18:34,683
You promised we'd pay for what
we did and you promised pain.

329
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:37,283
So are you here to make me pay?

330
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:40,884
Yeah. I did say that, didn't I?

331
00:18:40,968 --> 00:18:42,283
Huh?

332
00:18:42,367 --> 00:18:44,483
Let's forget about that.

333
00:18:44,567 --> 00:18:47,417
At first, I considered every person

334
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,884
on this side of the sea an enemy.

335
00:18:49,968 --> 00:18:54,751
But later, I crossed the sea
and slept under my enemy's roof.

336
00:18:54,835 --> 00:18:56,832
Ate the food they offered me.

337
00:18:58,367 --> 00:19:01,331
Reiner. I'm the same as you.

338
00:19:02,234 --> 00:19:04,884
Some of these people are awful.

339
00:19:04,968 --> 00:19:06,698
But some are good.

340
00:19:08,635 --> 00:19:10,417
Same where I'm from.

341
00:19:10,501 --> 00:19:14,483
Inside the walls, we're all just people.

342
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:16,617
But you were taught that
the people in the walls

343
00:19:16,701 --> 00:19:19,951
weren't like you, that we were demons.

344
00:19:20,034 --> 00:19:22,617
You were just kids who got brainwashed.

345
00:19:22,701 --> 00:19:25,684
Hatred was part of your training.

346
00:19:25,768 --> 00:19:30,483
As young as you were,
how could you have fought that?

347
00:19:30,567 --> 00:19:33,350
You couldn't have, and well it...

348
00:19:33,434 --> 00:19:35,832
It looks like you've already paid.

349
00:19:38,701 --> 00:19:41,765
No! You're wrong, Eren!

350
00:19:42,968 --> 00:19:44,417
That day...

351
00:19:44,501 --> 00:19:45,951
When the Titan got Marcel,

352
00:19:46,034 --> 00:19:48,617
Annie and Bertholdt wanted to
end the mission right then.

353
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:49,765
And they would've.

354
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:55,351
But I convinced them to keep going.

355
00:19:55,435 --> 00:19:58,684
Not just to save my own skin, but...

356
00:19:58,768 --> 00:20:01,617
Because I wanted to become a hero!

357
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:03,632
I wanted to be respected.

358
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:06,231
It's my fault!

359
00:20:07,167 --> 00:20:10,016
The... The truth is your
mother was eaten by a Titan

360
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,817
because of me!

361
00:20:11,901 --> 00:20:14,483
I have always hated my blood.

362
00:20:14,567 --> 00:20:16,283
And more than anyone,

363
00:20:16,367 --> 00:20:19,483
I have wished that
my race would disappear.

364
00:20:19,567 --> 00:20:21,683
I can't take this anymore.

365
00:20:21,767 --> 00:20:24,683
Please. Just kill me.

366
00:20:24,767 --> 00:20:28,283
However, I confess that I want to live.

367
00:20:28,367 --> 00:20:29,483
That despite everything,

368
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:33,884
I believe this world is my
birthright, just as it is yours.

369
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:36,683
The people gathered here
may belong to different races,

370
00:20:36,767 --> 00:20:39,884
different nations, but if
we're to survive this crisis

371
00:20:39,967 --> 00:20:44,483
then for the first time in
history, we must join as one.

372
00:20:44,567 --> 00:20:46,483
So please.

373
00:20:46,567 --> 00:20:48,817
If you wish to live,
then lend me your strength.

374
00:20:48,901 --> 00:20:52,298
Help me protect our world's future!

375
00:20:54,967 --> 00:20:58,483
If we work together,
we can overcome any obstacle.

376
00:20:58,567 --> 00:21:00,165
Any threat!

377
00:21:02,835 --> 00:21:07,483
I was right.
I am the same as you.

378
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:08,817
Huh?

379
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:10,283
I ask each of you to join me

380
00:21:10,367 --> 00:21:11,684
as I go to fight the devils

381
00:21:11,768 --> 00:21:13,617
who would plunge our world into hell.

382
00:21:13,701 --> 00:21:16,417
Help me defeat them!

383
00:21:16,501 --> 00:21:19,684
I think maybe we were born this way.

384
00:21:19,768 --> 00:21:20,617
Here and now,

385
00:21:20,701 --> 00:21:22,884
as a representative of
Marley's government,

386
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:26,417
I send this message
to the devils of Paradis.

387
00:21:26,501 --> 00:21:29,283
I'll just keep moving forward.

388
00:21:29,367 --> 00:21:30,217
Huh...?

389
00:21:30,301 --> 00:21:32,732
Till I've killed my enemies.

390
00:21:40,101 --> 00:21:42,351
Consider this

391
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,298
a declaration of war!

392
00:23:40,305 --> 00:23:43,353
The Attack Titan appears out of nowhere,

393
00:23:43,437 --> 00:23:47,887
roaring like a demon as it kills
enemies and innocents alike.

394
00:23:47,971 --> 00:23:51,753
To stop Eren's rampage,
the War Hammer swings.

395
00:23:51,837 --> 00:23:54,768
Next episode:
"The War Hammer Titan."
