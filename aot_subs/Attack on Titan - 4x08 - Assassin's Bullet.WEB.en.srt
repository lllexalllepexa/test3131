1
00:00:08,675 --> 00:00:10,306
It's Reiner!

2
00:00:40,742 --> 00:00:41,940
Eren!

3
00:00:43,809 --> 00:00:45,991
Seems to me this fight's over.

4
00:00:46,075 --> 00:00:48,339
We've used the last of our strength.

5
00:00:49,475 --> 00:00:51,391
As for Reiner,

6
00:00:51,475 --> 00:00:54,573
I can't exactly kill him at this point.

7
00:00:57,075 --> 00:01:00,439
Okay, fine.
Then let's go back home.

8
00:01:03,342 --> 00:01:05,840
See you later, Reiner.

9
00:01:23,675 --> 00:01:25,791
Guard the ship from any hostiles below.

10
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:28,859
If you've still got ammo,
then now's the time to use it.

11
00:01:28,943 --> 00:01:31,791
Looks like they're retreating.

12
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:34,339
Does this mean we're safe?

13
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:37,840
They're getting away.

14
00:01:41,742 --> 00:01:42,859
Gabi!

15
00:01:42,943 --> 00:01:47,391
Eren Jaeger!

16
00:01:47,475 --> 00:01:48,258
Gabi!

17
00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:52,006
You won't escape!
I'll shoot you down.

18
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:12,130
Well, aren't you a filthy sight?

19
00:04:14,264 --> 00:04:18,596
It's like you fell in
a pile of shit, Eren.

20
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:21,529
Captain Levi.

21
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:38,729
This takes me back, Eren.

22
00:04:39,598 --> 00:04:43,515
You have a real kickable face,
you know that?

23
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:47,915
Once you're tied up,
I'd like to have a longer chat.

24
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,981
That's all right by me,

25
00:04:50,065 --> 00:04:53,181
but I explained everything
in the letters I wrote.

26
00:04:53,265 --> 00:04:55,696
Did you not understand them?

27
00:04:57,799 --> 00:05:00,715
Tch. I know that face.

28
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,581
I used to see it on the rotten shits

29
00:05:02,665 --> 00:05:04,715
I met in the underground.

30
00:05:04,799 --> 00:05:07,996
Never thought I'd see it on you.

31
00:05:10,198 --> 00:05:11,915
Hey, cheer up.

32
00:05:11,999 --> 00:05:14,496
Everything went just like you wanted.

33
00:05:23,132 --> 00:05:26,696
Stop 'em!
Kill every last devil you can!

34
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:30,915
Everyone get inside!

35
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:33,049
If they had guns that
could take down an airship,

36
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:35,581
they'd've brought them out by now.

37
00:05:35,665 --> 00:05:38,781
Jean! You go in, too.

38
00:05:38,865 --> 00:05:40,515
I'll keep an eye on things.

39
00:05:40,599 --> 00:05:41,981
Understood, Commander Lobov!

40
00:05:42,065 --> 00:05:43,581
We're counting on you, sir!

41
00:05:43,665 --> 00:05:47,181
I already told you.
I'm just a recruit now!

42
00:05:47,265 --> 00:05:50,781
Our people don't need
the Garrison anymore!

43
00:05:50,865 --> 00:05:52,448
And that goes double for

44
00:05:52,532 --> 00:05:54,863
the overpaid geezers in charge of it!

45
00:05:56,933 --> 00:05:57,849
Jean!

46
00:05:57,933 --> 00:05:58,915
Grab on!

47
00:05:58,999 --> 00:06:00,396
Thanks, you two.

48
00:06:02,733 --> 00:06:03,981
Who's left?

49
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:06,181
We're still waiting on Lima Squad.

50
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:08,114
But assuming that
all of them make it back,

51
00:06:08,198 --> 00:06:10,181
we've lost six soldiers.

52
00:06:10,265 --> 00:06:12,114
Right. Shit.

53
00:06:12,198 --> 00:06:16,781
That's nothing compared to
the damage we did to the enemy.

54
00:06:16,865 --> 00:06:18,181
Good work, soldiers!

55
00:06:18,265 --> 00:06:21,448
We just fought the New
Eldian Empire's first battle

56
00:06:21,532 --> 00:06:22,781
and it ended in victory!

57
00:06:22,865 --> 00:06:27,581
Yeah!

58
00:06:27,665 --> 00:06:29,581
That's right! Celebrate!

59
00:06:29,665 --> 00:06:33,062
That's how we'll pay tribute
to our six fallen heroes!

60
00:06:35,532 --> 00:06:37,114
Our first battle.

61
00:06:37,198 --> 00:06:40,781
I wonder how many more
we'll have to fight.

62
00:06:40,865 --> 00:06:43,062
How many more'll have to die?

63
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:51,648
Honestly, I'm just glad that we made it.

64
00:06:51,732 --> 00:06:53,981
I know this isn't fair to the others,

65
00:06:54,064 --> 00:06:58,496
but you guys will always
be special... to me.

66
00:07:04,532 --> 00:07:06,448
That hurts, dumbass.

67
00:07:06,532 --> 00:07:08,981
Don't hug us while you've
got all that metal on.

68
00:07:09,064 --> 00:07:10,515
What'd you call me?

69
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:12,581
You're the only dumbass I see here.

70
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,981
Always playing with that
sorry excuse for a beard.

71
00:07:15,064 --> 00:07:15,648
Huh?

72
00:07:15,732 --> 00:07:17,181
Yeah, Conny's right!

73
00:07:17,265 --> 00:07:18,781
Even if you could grow a real beard,

74
00:07:18,865 --> 00:07:19,981
it's not like you could eat it.

75
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:20,915
Huh?!

76
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:23,048
Speaking of, are we eating soon?

77
00:07:23,132 --> 00:07:25,581
No. Not till
we reach the island.

78
00:07:25,665 --> 00:07:28,262
Seriously? Some leader you are.

79
00:07:30,865 --> 00:07:31,930
Gabi!

80
00:07:32,933 --> 00:07:35,396
Come on, Gabi, hold on a second!

81
00:07:48,665 --> 00:07:50,980
Stop. It's over.

82
00:07:51,064 --> 00:07:52,781
They're flying away, Gabi.

83
00:07:52,865 --> 00:07:55,448
There's no point in chasing them.

84
00:07:55,532 --> 00:07:56,930
Even you know that.

85
00:08:02,733 --> 00:08:04,715
They killed our friends.

86
00:08:04,799 --> 00:08:07,980
Zofia was right next to me, talking,

87
00:08:08,064 --> 00:08:11,581
and then she was crushed
by a flying rock.

88
00:08:11,665 --> 00:08:13,980
Udo tried to get it off her, but

89
00:08:14,064 --> 00:08:16,980
that just got him trampled by the crowd.

90
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:19,581
They stepped on his head again and again

91
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,781
till it cracked open.

92
00:08:21,865 --> 00:08:24,781
I ran into those gate guards we talk to,

93
00:08:24,865 --> 00:08:27,581
and they yelled at me

94
00:08:27,665 --> 00:08:30,581
'cause I was trying to
go back to the plaza.

95
00:08:30,665 --> 00:08:32,581
They said it was too dangerous.

96
00:08:32,665 --> 00:08:36,581
They tried to protect me
even though I'm Eldian.

97
00:08:36,665 --> 00:08:37,914
Now they're dead.

98
00:08:37,998 --> 00:08:40,929
I saw some woman
shoot them from a rooftop.

99
00:08:43,865 --> 00:08:47,181
Because I'm an Eldian who was
born in this internment zone,

100
00:08:47,265 --> 00:08:50,181
people spit at the sight
of me walking around.

101
00:08:50,265 --> 00:08:53,781
I have lots of memories
of getting treated like dirt,

102
00:08:53,865 --> 00:08:56,781
but they're the reason I try so hard.

103
00:08:56,865 --> 00:08:57,914
I'm fighting to show the world

104
00:08:57,998 --> 00:09:00,981
that the Eldians here are good people!

105
00:09:01,065 --> 00:09:03,515
I made it this far because
I believed that someday

106
00:09:03,599 --> 00:09:06,048
we could be proud of these armbands.

107
00:09:06,132 --> 00:09:09,515
I did everything I could
to make that happen,

108
00:09:09,599 --> 00:09:12,181
but now it's all been crushed.

109
00:09:12,265 --> 00:09:14,914
This internment zone is my home!

110
00:09:14,998 --> 00:09:18,914
I know it isn't perfect, but its
where the people I love live.

111
00:09:18,998 --> 00:09:22,630
So if somebody tramples it,
I'm not gonna forgive them.

112
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:26,364
So why?

113
00:09:27,132 --> 00:09:30,448
Why would you tell me not to chase them?

114
00:09:30,532 --> 00:09:32,515
Mister Zeke was killed
right in front of us.

115
00:09:32,599 --> 00:09:35,181
Don't you wanna do something?

116
00:09:35,265 --> 00:09:38,981
Don't you wanna know why
all these people had to die?

117
00:09:39,065 --> 00:09:41,181
So why, Reiner?

118
00:09:41,265 --> 00:09:45,696
Tell me why my mom was eaten by a Titan.

119
00:09:48,265 --> 00:09:50,048
Their home was trampled, too.

120
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:51,781
Huh?

121
00:09:51,864 --> 00:09:52,581
That's why.

122
00:09:52,665 --> 00:09:54,781
Our warriors attacked them years ago

123
00:09:54,864 --> 00:09:57,048
and killed lots of people.

124
00:09:57,132 --> 00:09:59,396
This is just revenge.

125
00:10:01,265 --> 00:10:05,781
So did you see that happen?

126
00:10:05,864 --> 00:10:09,581
Well no. I didn't.

127
00:10:09,665 --> 00:10:12,363
Neither did I, Falco.

128
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:25,115
It doesn't matter.

129
00:10:25,199 --> 00:10:28,981
These island devils threaten
world peace, remember?

130
00:10:29,065 --> 00:10:30,715
We were taught all about them.

131
00:10:30,798 --> 00:10:31,981
They're savage and cruel

132
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,181
and whatever we might've done to them,

133
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:35,581
it wasn't half as bad
as what they deserved.

134
00:10:35,665 --> 00:10:37,763
Those devils aren't like us.

135
00:10:40,665 --> 00:10:44,114
Reiner. I'm the same as you.

136
00:10:44,198 --> 00:10:45,848
Same where I'm from.

137
00:10:45,932 --> 00:10:49,630
Inside the walls, we're all just people.

138
00:10:56,998 --> 00:10:59,581
Lima Squad's in.
That makes everyone.

139
00:10:59,665 --> 00:11:01,581
All troops accounted for!

140
00:11:01,665 --> 00:11:03,515
Tell the bridge we're good to ascend!

141
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:04,663
Got it!

142
00:11:13,864 --> 00:11:15,430
It's just a kid!

143
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:25,363
I shot him down.

144
00:11:34,798 --> 00:11:38,496
The line. It's still attached.

145
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:41,596
Gabi!

146
00:11:43,665 --> 00:11:45,715
What do you think you're trying to do?

147
00:11:45,798 --> 00:11:48,896
It's this trigger.
If I pull it, then...

148
00:11:52,998 --> 00:11:55,780
Hold on. You wanna go up?

149
00:11:55,864 --> 00:11:57,530
Don't be crazy.

150
00:11:58,199 --> 00:12:00,515
I'll kill as many island devils as I can.

151
00:12:00,599 --> 00:12:01,515
Stop being an idiot,

152
00:12:01,599 --> 00:12:04,048
you're just gonna get yourself killed!

153
00:12:04,132 --> 00:12:06,781
Talk to my mom and dad for me.

154
00:12:06,865 --> 00:12:09,581
Talk to Reiner and the others, too.

155
00:12:09,665 --> 00:12:12,914
Tell them that I fought
my hardest, to the end.

156
00:12:12,998 --> 00:12:15,115
Even if I'm killed up there,

157
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:18,914
all of you will carry
my spirit forward, right?

158
00:12:18,998 --> 00:12:21,581
Falco! Gabi!

159
00:12:21,665 --> 00:12:22,848
Are you two okay?

160
00:12:22,932 --> 00:12:25,115
What're you doing out here?

161
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:26,781
It's Colt.

162
00:12:26,865 --> 00:12:30,781
This is it, Falco.
You take care.

163
00:12:30,865 --> 00:12:32,530
You're one of the good ones.

164
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:37,914
Surpass Gabi to protect her.

165
00:12:37,998 --> 00:12:40,962
Spare her from the dark future we face.

166
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,662
Falco!

167
00:12:49,998 --> 00:12:52,896
Falco?

168
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:55,315
Why come with me?

169
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,181
Because I'm the one who should
inherit the Armored Titan.

170
00:12:58,265 --> 00:12:59,581
You hear me?

171
00:12:59,664 --> 00:13:00,762
Huh?

172
00:13:07,732 --> 00:13:09,981
Hey, Jean, did you hear a sound just now?

173
00:13:10,065 --> 00:13:11,981
Hey! Quiet down for a second.

174
00:13:12,065 --> 00:13:14,914
Make some noise! To victory!

175
00:13:14,998 --> 00:13:16,181
Yeah!

176
00:13:16,265 --> 00:13:17,714
Guys.

177
00:13:17,798 --> 00:13:19,781
Hey. Lobov isn't back yet.

178
00:13:19,865 --> 00:13:22,729
Weird. He should've
come back a while ago.

179
00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:43,496
Sasha!

180
00:14:05,737 --> 00:14:08,853
Take that, you Marleyan bastards!

181
00:14:08,937 --> 00:14:11,386
Sasha! Sasha!

182
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:13,720
Hey. Stay with me.

183
00:14:13,804 --> 00:14:15,234
Hey!

184
00:14:16,737 --> 00:14:20,367
Why are you so loud...?

185
00:14:23,137 --> 00:14:27,853
Are we eating soon or what?

186
00:14:27,937 --> 00:14:30,653
She's bleeding! Find us
some bandages! Hurry!

187
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:31,386
Right!

188
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:34,035
Come on. Just hang in there.

189
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,401
Meat...

190
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:54,120
Jean. Lobov's dead.

191
00:14:54,203 --> 00:14:57,301
They shot him and climbed
aboard using his ODM gear.

192
00:14:58,804 --> 00:15:02,068
I'll toss 'em
outside. All right?

193
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:11,053
Do you really think
tossing kids out of an airship

194
00:15:11,136 --> 00:15:14,301
is gonna help us stop all this killing?

195
00:15:25,604 --> 00:15:28,252
What happened to Braun and Grice?

196
00:15:28,336 --> 00:15:29,252
They ran off.

197
00:15:29,336 --> 00:15:31,320
Neither one of them said
where they were going.

198
00:15:31,404 --> 00:15:33,234
I haven't seen 'em since.

199
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,035
Hey, Pieck.

200
00:15:42,404 --> 00:15:46,568
Commander. I remember now.

201
00:15:47,804 --> 00:15:50,853
I know that Marleyan soldier.

202
00:15:50,937 --> 00:15:55,653
The one who led us away from
the plaza and into a trap.

203
00:15:55,737 --> 00:15:59,186
I know exactly where I saw them last.

204
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:03,186
It was about three years ago
during an inspection

205
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:07,053
of the first survey fleet
to go to Paradis,

206
00:16:07,136 --> 00:16:09,720
after Reiner came back from his mission.

207
00:16:09,804 --> 00:16:13,653
Wait, the scout ships that disappeared?

208
00:16:13,737 --> 00:16:17,252
Yeah. I'm sure of it.

209
00:16:17,336 --> 00:16:22,120
That beard looked so unnatural on them.

210
00:16:22,204 --> 00:16:25,734
Hey. How long are you gonna
make me look at that thing?

211
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:29,735
What's your problem?
Everyone else likes it.

212
00:16:33,604 --> 00:16:36,386
Are they still celebrating our "victory"?

213
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:38,186
Let go of me!

214
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:41,453
You haven't defeated us yet,
you filthy island devils!

215
00:16:41,537 --> 00:16:43,586
You might've killed Zeke,
but not his spirit!

216
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,453
We'll carry his will forward!

217
00:16:46,537 --> 00:16:48,301
Gabi. Stop!

218
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,334
What do we do with 'em, Jean?

219
00:16:53,537 --> 00:16:55,252
Us true Eldians are gonna haunt you

220
00:16:55,336 --> 00:16:57,186
till you're all rotting in the ground.

221
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:01,386
You tell that to the bastard
who planned this once I'm dead!

222
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:03,467
Think I'll just take you to him.

223
00:17:04,737 --> 00:17:06,653
Then you can tell him yourself.

224
00:17:06,737 --> 00:17:08,734
Sound good to you?

225
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:21,787
How were you able to recognize them?

226
00:17:21,871 --> 00:17:24,453
Well. The soldier
happened to be

227
00:17:24,537 --> 00:17:27,601
someone I had a personal interest in.

228
00:17:28,671 --> 00:17:33,520
Because she's a devout
follower of Zeke Jaeger.

229
00:17:33,604 --> 00:17:39,252
Gabi, Falco?
How did you get here?

230
00:17:39,336 --> 00:17:41,186
What about you?

231
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,320
We thought that you were dead.

232
00:17:42,404 --> 00:17:43,453
They took you alive?

233
00:17:43,537 --> 00:17:46,635
But how is that possible?
Why would you let them?

234
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:52,320
Who the hell are these kids?

235
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,453
They somehow killed Lobov,

236
00:17:54,537 --> 00:17:56,853
and then used his gear to climb aboard.

237
00:17:56,937 --> 00:17:59,601
This one shot Sasha
before we could catch her.

238
00:18:01,937 --> 00:18:04,734
I don't think she's gonna make it.

239
00:18:11,136 --> 00:18:13,853
I'll leave the rest to you, Onyankopon.

240
00:18:13,936 --> 00:18:15,401
I'm on it, Hange!

241
00:18:17,936 --> 00:18:18,920
Well, Zeke.

242
00:18:19,003 --> 00:18:22,252
It seems everything's
played out just like you wanted.

243
00:18:22,336 --> 00:18:23,568
Wouldn't you say?

244
00:18:27,737 --> 00:18:30,453
I did make a few miscalculations,

245
00:18:30,537 --> 00:18:33,034
but aside from that, I would.

246
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,853
Zeke?

247
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:39,520
Huh? Wait, who are these kids?

248
00:18:39,604 --> 00:18:41,520
Miscalculations.

249
00:18:41,604 --> 00:18:42,653
Damn it, Yelena!

250
00:18:42,737 --> 00:18:44,787
Why didn't you lock down
the Cart Titan and Jaw Titan

251
00:18:44,871 --> 00:18:46,453
like you said you would?

252
00:18:46,537 --> 00:18:49,052
We lost good people because of you!

253
00:18:49,136 --> 00:18:50,453
I'm sorry.

254
00:18:50,537 --> 00:18:54,052
I can assure you that
they both fell into the pit,

255
00:18:54,136 --> 00:18:56,453
but it's still my fault.

256
00:18:56,537 --> 00:18:59,386
Guess that's why you threw
more rocks at us than planned.

257
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:02,653
You had to put on a show
for your comrades, didn't ya?

258
00:19:02,737 --> 00:19:06,653
Quite the performance,
coming from a mangy furball.

259
00:19:06,737 --> 00:19:09,052
Yeah. Well done.

260
00:19:09,136 --> 00:19:12,120
Aw. Please don't glare, Levi.

261
00:19:12,204 --> 00:19:15,253
You don't wanna make me
piss my pants, do you?

262
00:19:15,337 --> 00:19:18,186
And you gave quite
the performance, yourself.

263
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:21,535
Considering how bad you wish
you could actually kill me.

264
00:19:23,671 --> 00:19:26,252
I'm the kind of person
who saves the best bite

265
00:19:26,336 --> 00:19:28,386
for the end of my meal.

266
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:31,468
I can really savor the taste that way.

267
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,252
We killed Marley's brass

268
00:19:35,336 --> 00:19:38,587
and took out their
primary fleet and port.

269
00:19:38,671 --> 00:19:41,453
That oughtta buy us some time.

270
00:19:41,537 --> 00:19:43,587
Before the whole world
comes crashing down on us

271
00:19:43,671 --> 00:19:46,453
with a coordinated attack, you mean.

272
00:19:46,537 --> 00:19:49,320
Every single time you
get yourself caught,

273
00:19:49,404 --> 00:19:52,052
we give up lives to get you back.

274
00:19:52,136 --> 00:19:55,120
No matter how high the cost, we pay it.

275
00:19:55,204 --> 00:19:58,186
You noticed that trend
and used it against us.

276
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:01,186
Held yourself hostage to force our hand.

277
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:05,186
We had no choice except
to do what you wanted.

278
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:07,253
You put your trust in us,

279
00:20:07,337 --> 00:20:10,434
and we've lost our trust in you, Eren.

280
00:20:11,537 --> 00:20:13,386
You gain from this, too.

281
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,186
You now possess the Founding Titan

282
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:17,520
as well as a Titan with royal blood.

283
00:20:17,604 --> 00:20:22,453
All your comrade's sacrifices
are about to bear fruit at last.

284
00:20:22,537 --> 00:20:24,501
Eldia will be free.

285
00:20:35,671 --> 00:20:37,587
It's Sasha.

286
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:39,501
She just died.

287
00:20:59,604 --> 00:21:01,720
Conny.

288
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:07,986
Did Sasha... leave you...
any last words?

289
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,933
She asked... for some meat.

290
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:23,453
Can you guys keep a secret,

291
00:21:23,537 --> 00:21:27,168
'cause I totally just helped
myself to the Officer's Pantry.

292
00:21:29,936 --> 00:21:31,852
But hey. It'll be all right.

293
00:21:31,936 --> 00:21:33,852
I mean once we've taken our land back,

294
00:21:33,936 --> 00:21:36,967
we'll have all the room
we need for livestock!

295
00:21:49,803 --> 00:21:51,520
Eren.

296
00:21:51,604 --> 00:21:54,852
Sasha only died because you
dragged the Scouts into this.

297
00:21:54,936 --> 00:21:56,468
You know that?

298
00:23:41,004 --> 00:23:44,453
Was there some other
hidden path they could've taken?

299
00:23:44,536 --> 00:23:47,586
The immutable past renders
that question irrelevant.

300
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,187
They have no choice

301
00:23:49,271 --> 00:23:52,053
but to continue down
the path before them.

302
00:23:52,137 --> 00:23:54,768
