1
00:00:01,349 --> 00:00:02,731
Take a good look, Zeke.

2
00:00:02,815 --> 00:00:05,665
That's Liberio, the place where we live.

3
00:00:05,749 --> 00:00:09,598
Compared to the world,
it's as small as a birdcage.

4
00:00:09,682 --> 00:00:12,198
And since the nation of
Marley won't let us leave,

5
00:00:12,282 --> 00:00:15,064
we're going to have to
live there 'til we die.

6
00:00:15,148 --> 00:00:17,331
Hey, Zeke. Wouldn't you like
to be free of that place

7
00:00:17,415 --> 00:00:19,131
if it were possible?

8
00:00:19,215 --> 00:00:21,079
Yeah. That'd be nice.

9
00:00:22,415 --> 00:00:24,531
Oh, do we have visitors already?

10
00:00:24,615 --> 00:00:27,131
Folks hardly ever
come up here this early.

11
00:00:27,215 --> 00:00:29,331
I'll come back when you're finished.

12
00:00:29,415 --> 00:00:32,580
It's okay. We were actually
just on our way out.

13
00:00:37,215 --> 00:00:40,531
Ah. So you're Eldians.

14
00:00:40,615 --> 00:00:41,531
Hey, what was that for?

15
00:00:41,615 --> 00:00:43,531
We're allowed to be outside
of the walls right now,

16
00:00:43,615 --> 00:00:44,665
we received permission!

17
00:00:44,749 --> 00:00:47,331
I'm here to clean this tower
and rid it of filth.

18
00:00:47,415 --> 00:00:49,398
That means removing trash and vermin.

19
00:00:49,482 --> 00:00:51,731
You demons have tainted my workplace!

20
00:00:51,815 --> 00:00:55,465
Understand? Your kind used to
massacre everyone they could!

21
00:00:55,549 --> 00:00:59,079
You should be wiped out,
so why are you breeding?

22
00:01:01,615 --> 00:01:02,531
Piss off, you devils!

23
00:01:02,615 --> 00:01:04,331
Stay in your cage, you filth-bloods!

24
00:01:04,415 --> 00:01:06,731
You even smell filthy!

25
00:01:06,815 --> 00:01:09,531
Never forget how this feels, Zeke.

26
00:01:09,615 --> 00:01:11,331
This is the outside world.

27
00:01:11,415 --> 00:01:12,665
If you can't stand it as it is,

28
00:01:12,749 --> 00:01:15,131
then you're gonna have to change it.

29
00:01:15,215 --> 00:01:19,746
Zeke. We need you
to save everyone.

30
00:03:00,721 --> 00:03:03,903
You want one of these
kids to become my successor?

31
00:03:03,986 --> 00:03:06,370
Yes, we'll choose eventually.

32
00:03:06,454 --> 00:03:09,437
One's lagging
behind the pack. Who is it?

33
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:11,903
It's Jaeger again.

34
00:03:11,986 --> 00:03:14,503
All the other kids are competing
fiercely for the honor

35
00:03:14,587 --> 00:03:17,570
of becoming Warriors
and Honorary Marleyans.

36
00:03:17,654 --> 00:03:19,236
Jaeger doesn't look to be anywhere near

37
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,771
as driven as the rest.

38
00:03:20,855 --> 00:03:23,303
Honestly, I have no idea
why he still bothers

39
00:03:23,387 --> 00:03:25,318
to show up here at all.

40
00:03:25,986 --> 00:03:28,370
So how's training going so far?

41
00:03:28,454 --> 00:03:29,771
To be honest, it's tough.

42
00:03:29,855 --> 00:03:31,036
Well, just keep trying.

43
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,771
If you work hard, then I'm sure
they'll make you a Warrior.

44
00:03:33,855 --> 00:03:35,703
After all, you have a very special power

45
00:03:35,787 --> 00:03:36,771
in your blood, Zeke.

46
00:03:36,855 --> 00:03:37,771
And more importantly,

47
00:03:37,855 --> 00:03:40,852
we know you'll stand out
because you're our son.

48
00:03:41,655 --> 00:03:45,303
Father, Mother.
Thanks for watching Zeke.

49
00:03:45,387 --> 00:03:46,370
Mm-hmm.

50
00:03:46,454 --> 00:03:47,236
I knew you were coming,

51
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,303
so I baked your favorite pie again.

52
00:03:49,387 --> 00:03:50,303
Really?

53
00:03:50,387 --> 00:03:51,837
Your "social dance club" again?

54
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,303
Look. We're happy to watch Zeke,
but he misses his parents.

55
00:03:55,387 --> 00:03:56,503
It's more than a dance club,

56
00:03:56,587 --> 00:03:58,503
we're helping Liberio stay healthy.

57
00:03:58,587 --> 00:04:00,303
He may be confused right now,

58
00:04:00,387 --> 00:04:03,518
but someday Zeke will understand
everything we're doing.

59
00:04:04,987 --> 00:04:06,837
This is the Tragedy of Lago.

60
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,902
It occurred 1,200 years ago.

61
00:04:08,986 --> 00:04:11,902
After destroying Lago
in the course of a single day,

62
00:04:11,986 --> 00:04:13,837
the Titans continued their advance,

63
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,503
going on to commit
the Devastation of Monte

64
00:04:16,587 --> 00:04:18,437
and the Ravaging of Valle.

65
00:04:18,521 --> 00:04:20,771
These atrocities led to
the deaths of hundreds

66
00:04:20,855 --> 00:04:23,503
of thousands of Marleyans.

67
00:04:23,587 --> 00:04:25,571
There were a few civilians
who managed to escape

68
00:04:25,655 --> 00:04:29,303
from Lago and flee into the
surrounding countryside.

69
00:04:29,387 --> 00:04:31,837
However, the Eldian Empire
had planted Titans

70
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,637
along the Marleyan's escape
routes, so as day broke,

71
00:04:34,721 --> 00:04:37,437
the Titans awoke and the Marleyans were...

72
00:04:37,521 --> 00:04:41,902
Yeah, I know. A lot of people
ended up dying, right?

73
00:04:41,986 --> 00:04:43,771
Tell us, Zeke,
is your father teaching you

74
00:04:43,855 --> 00:04:45,902
the true history of Eldia?

75
00:04:45,986 --> 00:04:46,837
Yeah, he says that Eldians

76
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,437
did lots of horrible things to Marleyans.

77
00:04:49,521 --> 00:04:52,837
And that we all have to atone
for the sins of our ancestors.

78
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,837
Do you really want to become a Warrior

79
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,218
and fight for Marley?

80
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:02,418
Yeah. I want to be a Warrior.

81
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:07,902
Well. You should
get to bed now.

82
00:05:07,986 --> 00:05:09,103
Tell you what. Next time,

83
00:05:09,187 --> 00:05:11,836
we can read the rest of the
book about the cat's house!

84
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,552
Sounds good to me!

85
00:05:20,721 --> 00:05:21,685
Begin!

86
00:05:39,254 --> 00:05:40,552
Aww!

87
00:05:43,787 --> 00:05:45,571
You're awful at this, Dad!

88
00:05:45,655 --> 00:05:47,318
Kick it harder. 'Kay?

89
00:05:51,521 --> 00:05:52,303
Dad!

90
00:05:52,387 --> 00:05:53,103
Yes, what is it?

91
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,437
Hey! I finished
training early today!

92
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,237
- -Do you think we could...
- -Oh, good.

93
00:05:57,321 --> 00:05:59,718
That means the two of us can study more.

94
00:06:03,454 --> 00:06:06,771
In summary, the Tragedy
of Lago never happened.

95
00:06:06,854 --> 00:06:10,571
Nor did the Devastation of Monte
or the Ravaging of Valle.

96
00:06:10,655 --> 00:06:13,503
They're all just stories
made up by Marley.

97
00:06:13,587 --> 00:06:16,437
Marley wants you to believe
that the Eldian Empire

98
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:18,370
had cruel customs and a brutal culture.

99
00:06:18,454 --> 00:06:19,503
But that can't be.

100
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,437
Because our great Founder
Ymir would have never

101
00:06:21,521 --> 00:06:23,571
wished for that, right?
It's unthinkable.

102
00:06:23,655 --> 00:06:25,836
Huh. Yes, that's exactly right.

103
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,503
You're starting to catch on, Zeke!

104
00:06:28,587 --> 00:06:29,503
Yeah!

105
00:06:29,587 --> 00:06:32,303
If you don't have the drive, then leave.

106
00:06:32,387 --> 00:06:34,303
This country only has use for Warriors

107
00:06:34,387 --> 00:06:36,903
who are prepared to devote
everything to their motherland.

108
00:06:36,987 --> 00:06:39,370
Marley would never trust someone like you

109
00:06:39,454 --> 00:06:42,818
with one of the Titans that our
soldiers have to depend on.

110
00:06:48,987 --> 00:06:51,571
Hey! You, over there!

111
00:06:51,655 --> 00:06:54,285
Mind taking a second to toss that back?

112
00:06:59,854 --> 00:07:03,571
H-Hey! You've actually got
a pretty good arm, for a kid.

113
00:07:03,655 --> 00:07:05,370
Uh...

114
00:07:05,454 --> 00:07:06,637
Here!

115
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,903
Nice! You caught it.

116
00:07:08,987 --> 00:07:10,703
I'm sick of throwing off the wall.

117
00:07:10,786 --> 00:07:14,237
Can I interest you in sticking
around for a game of catch?

118
00:07:14,321 --> 00:07:15,503
Your armband is red.

119
00:07:15,587 --> 00:07:16,703
Does that mean you're a...

120
00:07:16,786 --> 00:07:20,503
One of those Marleyan Warriors
that you aim to become.

121
00:07:20,587 --> 00:07:22,903
But my Beast isn't much use in a war,

122
00:07:22,987 --> 00:07:25,237
so I don't exactly live up to the title.

123
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:28,571
For the most part, I hang
around here playing catch.

124
00:07:28,655 --> 00:07:30,702
The name's Tom Ksaver,

125
00:07:30,786 --> 00:07:33,571
and I work as a researcher,
studying Titans.

126
00:07:33,655 --> 00:07:36,503
Throw it! And while you're
at it, tell me your name!

127
00:07:36,587 --> 00:07:39,318
Nice to meet you.
I'm Zeke Jaeger!

128
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,303
Your throw has some
serious heat behind it, Zeke.

129
00:07:43,387 --> 00:07:45,251
You're a natural, really.

130
00:07:50,254 --> 00:07:52,503
Hey! I'm home!
Guess what, Dad?

131
00:07:52,587 --> 00:07:54,237
That's not what you told me!

132
00:07:54,321 --> 00:07:56,237
Are you serious, Grice?

133
00:07:56,321 --> 00:07:57,903
If Zeke isn't chosen to be a Warrior,

134
00:07:57,987 --> 00:07:59,702
then the entire plan will fall apart!

135
00:07:59,786 --> 00:08:01,437
I know that. But the Owl says

136
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:03,637
that they can only intervene
and get Zeke selected

137
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,903
as a Warrior if he has decent scores.

138
00:08:05,987 --> 00:08:07,237
And right now, he doesn't.

139
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,703
Well, then what do we do?

140
00:08:08,787 --> 00:08:11,371
A chance like this only
comes once in a century!

141
00:08:11,455 --> 00:08:12,503
Hold on a second.

142
00:08:12,587 --> 00:08:14,702
Zeke still has a chance
to come back, doesn't he?

143
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:18,851
Yeah. Yeah, it's possible at
least. If Zeke steps up and...

144
00:08:25,387 --> 00:08:27,371
Um. I'm sorry, Dad.

145
00:08:27,455 --> 00:08:29,903
Zeke! I know you can do this.

146
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:31,437
You must have what it takes.

147
00:08:31,521 --> 00:08:33,783
After all, you're our son!

148
00:08:34,321 --> 00:08:37,636
Could've sworn I said
that Marley had no use for you.

149
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,636
So why the hell did you come back?

150
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,503
T-To show my loyalty to Marley,

151
00:08:42,587 --> 00:08:44,903
and to atone for the sins of Eldia!

152
00:08:44,987 --> 00:08:47,651
Please allow me to take part
in open training, sir!

153
00:09:04,787 --> 00:09:06,636
What are you doing, Jaeger?

154
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,151
Run, boy! Get moving!

155
00:09:10,321 --> 00:09:12,303
Dammit! This is bullshit!

156
00:09:12,387 --> 00:09:14,237
Don't talk like that!
We need to support him.

157
00:09:14,321 --> 00:09:15,503
He's trying his best.
Can't you see that?

158
00:09:15,587 --> 00:09:17,237
His best isn't enough!

159
00:09:17,321 --> 00:09:19,851
He'll never become a Warrior like that!

160
00:09:20,455 --> 00:09:24,371
You were a real mess the other day, huh?

161
00:09:24,455 --> 00:09:25,903
I don't see what's funny about it.

162
00:09:25,987 --> 00:09:26,636
They're just keeping me around

163
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,836
to run stupid errands for them now.

164
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,385
Whatever chance I had, it's gone.

165
00:09:33,586 --> 00:09:35,836
Didn't seem like you really
wanted to be a Warrior.

166
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,836
Not from what I could see.

167
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,170
I had to become a
Marleyan Warrior. I needed to.

168
00:09:41,254 --> 00:09:43,703
Thing is, I just wasn't good enough.

169
00:09:43,787 --> 00:09:44,903
No big deal.

170
00:09:44,987 --> 00:09:47,636
It'd be stupid to become a Warrior.

171
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,836
Not only would you shorten your lifespan,

172
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,437
you'd have to spend
your life killing people

173
00:09:51,521 --> 00:09:53,583
in other countries for Marley.

174
00:09:57,321 --> 00:09:59,371
Then why did you become a Warrior?

175
00:09:59,455 --> 00:10:02,303
Because I wanted to find out
the secrets of the Titans.

176
00:10:02,387 --> 00:10:05,085
Like I told you, I work as a researcher.

177
00:10:06,387 --> 00:10:08,503
It's a mystery. They say
it all started when

178
00:10:08,586 --> 00:10:11,503
the Founder Ymir touched
an unknown "something."

179
00:10:11,586 --> 00:10:14,703
I wanted to look back 2,000
years and see what it was.

180
00:10:14,787 --> 00:10:16,836
Enough that I was
willing to shorten my life

181
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:19,903
for the chance to look
through Titan memories.

182
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:21,636
To be honest with you,

183
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,303
that's why I'm useless
when it comes to fighting.

184
00:10:24,387 --> 00:10:27,703
It's just, compared to
the mysteries of Titans,

185
00:10:27,787 --> 00:10:30,452
hatred and war seem awfully trivial.

186
00:10:31,586 --> 00:10:32,703
So yeah.

187
00:10:32,787 --> 00:10:34,703
I don't think we're weak so much
as we're just disinclined

188
00:10:34,787 --> 00:10:37,503
to 'play war' with the rest of them.

189
00:10:37,586 --> 00:10:40,717
We're both decent people,
a real rarity in this world.

190
00:10:45,387 --> 00:10:46,570
This is for the best.

191
00:10:46,654 --> 00:10:48,837
Even if I can't leave
the Internment Zone,

192
00:10:48,921 --> 00:10:51,418
I'll still be alive, at least.

193
00:10:58,255 --> 00:10:59,903
We've finally pinned 'em down.

194
00:10:59,987 --> 00:11:02,703
They call themselves the
"Eldian Restorationists."

195
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,303
It's a pretty large group.

196
00:11:04,387 --> 00:11:05,502
Apparently, it was formed by

197
00:11:05,586 --> 00:11:07,836
a traitor called the "Owl."

198
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,503
Our people are looking into
several leads as we speak.

199
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:12,636
It's just a matter of time now.

200
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,684
We'll get the proof we need.

201
00:11:15,787 --> 00:11:19,437
Zeke? Is something wrong?

202
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,570
Why aren't you eating your supper?

203
00:11:21,654 --> 00:11:23,718
M-My stomach hurts.

204
00:11:33,787 --> 00:11:36,770
I'm sorry, but please.

205
00:11:36,854 --> 00:11:39,903
Stop going out and
doing dangerous things.

206
00:11:39,987 --> 00:11:41,437
Look. If you get caught,

207
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,903
we'll all be sent to
the Island of Devils.

208
00:11:43,987 --> 00:11:46,303
First, they'll ship us to Paradise,

209
00:11:46,387 --> 00:11:48,903
and then they'll make us Titans.

210
00:11:48,987 --> 00:11:50,703
Have you somehow managed to learn nothing

211
00:11:50,787 --> 00:11:52,502
from me after all this time?

212
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:55,303
Unless someone takes a stand,
our people will be doomed

213
00:11:55,387 --> 00:11:58,303
to live pitiful lives trapped
in this tiny cage forever.

214
00:11:58,387 --> 00:11:59,171
Yes, that's right.

215
00:11:59,255 --> 00:12:01,237
We're fighting to create
a dignified future

216
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:04,703
for Eldian people everywhere,
including you, Zeke.

217
00:12:04,787 --> 00:12:06,636
But would you still say that if you knew

218
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,118
that I could end up like Aunt Fay?

219
00:12:09,987 --> 00:12:10,837
Damn it, Zeke!

220
00:12:10,921 --> 00:12:13,237
You know the only reason
Fay isn't alive now

221
00:12:13,321 --> 00:12:15,903
is because the world is such
a sick and twisted place.

222
00:12:15,987 --> 00:12:18,436
We need to fight and
fix the world so that no one

223
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,303
will ever have to meet her fate again!

224
00:12:20,387 --> 00:12:23,171
That's why we're fighting
to restore Eldia's strength!

225
00:12:23,255 --> 00:12:26,484
That's why we're determined
to win our rights back!

226
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:36,603
You're kidding me!

227
00:12:36,687 --> 00:12:39,270
Your parents are Restorationists?

228
00:12:39,354 --> 00:12:40,536
They'll be caught.

229
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,536
You'll all be sent to Paradise!

230
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,985
Yeah.

231
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,736
Mr. Ksaver.

232
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,603
Thanks for playing
catch with me. I'm grateful.

233
00:12:50,687 --> 00:12:51,736
Um...

234
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:55,285
Even when I'm a Titan,
I'll cherish those memories.

235
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,451
Well. Goodbye.

236
00:13:03,888 --> 00:13:04,817
Report them.

237
00:13:06,487 --> 00:13:09,403
You have to.
It's your only hope.

238
00:13:09,487 --> 00:13:10,736
If you show your loyalty to Marley

239
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,470
by turning your parents
in to the authorities,

240
00:13:13,554 --> 00:13:16,118
you and your grandparents should be safe.

241
00:13:17,221 --> 00:13:18,736
No. I could never!

242
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,870
Zeke! Your parents
have been awful to you,

243
00:13:21,954 --> 00:13:23,536
they've used you!

244
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,270
They never spared a thought
for how you felt.

245
00:13:26,353 --> 00:13:27,736
They gave up on you.

246
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:31,470
The truth is, they never loved you!

247
00:13:31,554 --> 00:13:35,052
Zeke, you've done nothing wrong.

248
00:13:38,088 --> 00:13:43,052
You're a smart kid. A good kid.

249
00:13:47,554 --> 00:13:50,536
Take it easy, Zeke, the next
one might knock me over!

250
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,336
Too much for
an old geezer to handle, huh?

251
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,417
Hey! I'm not that old,
you little...

252
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,651
Mr. Ksaver!

253
00:14:02,221 --> 00:14:05,670
Though it's time I faced the
fact that my term's almost over.

254
00:14:05,754 --> 00:14:07,270
Yeah.

255
00:14:07,353 --> 00:14:09,470
I'll never actually get to grow old,

256
00:14:09,554 --> 00:14:12,403
but I don't regret my life of research.

257
00:14:12,487 --> 00:14:15,470
Think I can release all
my findings in one compilation.

258
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:18,204
Huh. What'd you figure out?

259
00:14:18,287 --> 00:14:19,403
Most of my findings're about

260
00:14:19,487 --> 00:14:23,204
the Founding Titan's power
over Subjects of Ymir. Like us.

261
00:14:23,287 --> 00:14:24,736
Oh. You said that it could

262
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,137
rewrite people's memories, right?

263
00:14:27,221 --> 00:14:28,603
Yeah, but that isn't all it can do.

264
00:14:28,687 --> 00:14:30,603
I found out that it's also able to change

265
00:14:30,687 --> 00:14:33,336
the anatomy of all of our bodies.

266
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:37,269
Around 600 years ago,
an epidemic swept the world,

267
00:14:37,353 --> 00:14:40,137
causing a drastic decline
in its population.

268
00:14:40,221 --> 00:14:44,070
But suddenly, the disease
vanished from the Eldian Empire.

269
00:14:44,154 --> 00:14:46,736
Every last citizen was cured.

270
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,336
It was the King's doing.

271
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,269
With the Founding Titan's power,
he redesigned the bodies

272
00:14:51,353 --> 00:14:53,536
of his subjects and made them immune.

273
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:57,137
We Eldians are extensions of
the Founding Titan's body.

274
00:14:57,221 --> 00:15:00,336
We're all connected to it,
no matter where we go.

275
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,251
Scary, isn't it?

276
00:15:04,353 --> 00:15:05,269
Then...

277
00:15:05,353 --> 00:15:06,336
You should be wiped out,

278
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,270
so why are you breeding?

279
00:15:08,354 --> 00:15:10,870
Would it be possible for
the Founder to make it so that

280
00:15:10,954 --> 00:15:13,685
none of us can have children anymore?

281
00:15:15,154 --> 00:15:18,137
If Subjects of Ymir stopped giving birth,

282
00:15:18,221 --> 00:15:20,137
then Titans would be gone from this world

283
00:15:20,221 --> 00:15:22,670
within the next hundred
years or so, right?

284
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:25,336
And if that happened,
then the world would be free

285
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:28,470
from fear and suffering
at the hands of Titans.

286
00:15:28,554 --> 00:15:29,470
What's more.

287
00:15:29,554 --> 00:15:32,336
If we Eldians hadn't been
born in the first place,

288
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,384
we wouldn't've had to suffer either!

289
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,118
Mr. Ksaver?

290
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,270
I never intended to tell you this,

291
00:15:42,354 --> 00:15:45,203
but many years ago,
I had a wife and child.

292
00:15:45,287 --> 00:15:46,137
In my foolish youth,

293
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:49,403
I'd removed my armband
and hidden my identity.

294
00:15:49,487 --> 00:15:51,870
I concealed it even from
the woman I married.

295
00:15:51,954 --> 00:15:54,536
The mother of my son.

296
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,736
You see, she was a proud Marleyan.

297
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,736
And well,

298
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,270
I knew that she would
find me out eventually,

299
00:16:01,354 --> 00:16:04,270
but I never suspected
that when that day came,

300
00:16:04,354 --> 00:16:08,137
she would slit our son's
throat and then her own.

301
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,336
I decided to become
a Warrior because I wanted

302
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:15,536
to kill myself in the
grandest way I could. But...

303
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,336
Over the last 13 years,

304
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:20,203
I ended up immersing myself
in Titan research,

305
00:16:20,287 --> 00:16:23,536
getting to know you,
playing games of catch.

306
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,284
We had fun, right?

307
00:16:26,154 --> 00:16:29,336
I looked for my dead son in you, Zeke.

308
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,736
I used my Titan powers
to run from my sins.

309
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:36,651
All the while wishing that I had
never been born to this world.

310
00:16:38,153 --> 00:16:39,670
I'll inherit your Titan.

311
00:16:39,754 --> 00:16:43,670
Not for Marley's sake,
but for the sake of the world.

312
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:47,485
I'll take the Founder, and I'll
use its power to save everyone.

313
00:16:48,954 --> 00:16:50,403
I'll end our cursed race,

314
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:52,604
freeing the world from
its fear of Titans,

315
00:16:52,688 --> 00:16:55,318
and freeing our people
from their suffering!

316
00:16:59,754 --> 00:17:01,403
Listen. This is something

317
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:03,804
I've kept secret from Marley.

318
00:17:03,888 --> 00:17:07,071
There's a way to break
the vow renouncing war.

319
00:17:07,154 --> 00:17:08,736
And well, as luck would have it,

320
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:12,270
you're the one person
who can make use of it.

321
00:17:12,354 --> 00:17:15,336
If a Titan who has royal blood
comes into contact

322
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,536
with the holder of the Founding Titan,

323
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,670
then the Founder's
full power can be drawn out.

324
00:17:20,754 --> 00:17:24,336
However, that power
won't be yours to direct.

325
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:27,536
What its used for will be
up to the Founder's host.

326
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,403
Essentially, you're like
the key to a lock.

327
00:17:31,487 --> 00:17:35,804
Which means you need the Founder
to be held by someone you trust.

328
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:40,052
Someone who can understand
our "euthanization" plan.

329
00:17:41,354 --> 00:17:43,718
I know you'll find that someone.

330
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,136
And I promise.

331
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:53,203
I'll always watch over you, Zeke.

332
00:17:53,287 --> 00:17:56,551
Don't worry,
I'll find them. Father.

333
00:18:00,554 --> 00:18:03,136
Eren Jaeger?

334
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,536
Yes. Eren is definitely
in possession of the Founder.

335
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,203
On top of that, he says
there's vital information

336
00:18:09,287 --> 00:18:11,136
in the basement of his old home.

337
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,404
The home he had to abandon
when Shiganshina fell.

338
00:18:14,488 --> 00:18:17,804
Tell me. Did Eren tell you guys
anything about his family?

339
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,736
Such as who his father was?

340
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,336
He did. He said
his dad was missing,

341
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,284
but that he used to be a doctor.

342
00:18:26,354 --> 00:18:30,736
Unbelievable!
So that father was alive?

343
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:34,404
Eren. We're both victims.

344
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:37,536
Your father has brainwashed you.

345
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:39,536
But someday,

346
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:42,118
I'll come back and save you!

347
00:18:45,488 --> 00:18:47,336
You've changed.

348
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,685
Now you do look a bit like our father.

349
00:18:53,688 --> 00:18:57,136
First of all, thanks for
agreeing to meet with me.

350
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,136
I'm glad we're getting to talk.

351
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,270
You spoke with Yelena,

352
00:19:00,354 --> 00:19:03,336
which means you know where I stand.

353
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,470
The Eldian euthanization plan.

354
00:19:05,554 --> 00:19:08,404
Do you support it or not?

355
00:19:08,488 --> 00:19:11,136
Four years back, something happened

356
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,470
to open one of our Dad's memories to me.

357
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:16,737
I relived his memory of
the night he slaughtered

358
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:19,536
the royal family of the walls.

359
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,604
He crushed their little kids.

360
00:19:21,688 --> 00:19:24,804
Smeared them like bugs.

361
00:19:24,888 --> 00:19:27,670
I felt their bodies break.

362
00:19:27,754 --> 00:19:30,470
If those kids had lived, the royal family

363
00:19:30,554 --> 00:19:32,470
would've reclaimed the Founder.

364
00:19:32,554 --> 00:19:35,270
And bound to the vow renouncing war,

365
00:19:35,354 --> 00:19:37,604
humanity inside of
the walls would've lost

366
00:19:37,688 --> 00:19:39,737
any chance of surviving.

367
00:19:39,821 --> 00:19:44,404
The deaths of those children
are what allowed us to live.

368
00:19:44,488 --> 00:19:48,270
Interesting. So does that
mean you agree with him?

369
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,203
Think he did the right thing?

370
00:19:50,287 --> 00:19:52,818
No. Our old man was mistaken.

371
00:19:53,754 --> 00:19:56,270
What's more, I think it'd be fair to say

372
00:19:56,354 --> 00:19:59,136
that I'm just another mistake of his.

373
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,070
If the Eldians in this town
had never been born,

374
00:20:02,154 --> 00:20:04,536
then none of them would
have to suffer and die

375
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:08,136
in the plan that you and I
are about to carry out.

376
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,536
This world was never our birthright.

377
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,536
It's a hell to be saved from.

378
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:14,737
I'll do it, Zeke.

379
00:20:14,821 --> 00:20:15,936
When the moment comes.

380
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:20,604
I'll bring 2,000 years of
Titan domination to an end.

381
00:20:20,688 --> 00:20:23,670
Until then, we both keep moving forward.

382
00:20:23,754 --> 00:20:26,318
All right? Brother?

383
00:20:28,821 --> 00:20:31,536
Yeah. Precisely.

384
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:32,804
It's settled, then.

385
00:20:32,888 --> 00:20:33,936
Okay.

386
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,336
I want nothing more than
to shake your hand, Eren.

387
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:41,670
But, well, it's best if we don't
make physical contact yet.

388
00:20:41,754 --> 00:20:45,336
So in lieu of that, I'll give you this.

389
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:49,018
Eren. We're gonna save everyone.

390
00:20:53,688 --> 00:20:56,652
The only way to save us Eldians...

391
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,752
is to put us out of our misery.

392
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,336
That was your plan?
Mercy killings?

393
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:13,070
Well, you're about to die
inside a Titan's stinking mouth,

394
00:21:13,154 --> 00:21:14,404
listening to the sound of your body

395
00:21:14,488 --> 00:21:17,470
being chewed into tiny pieces.

396
00:21:17,554 --> 00:21:21,536
I'd say that's a pretty merciful
way to kill you, right?

397
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:24,737
When you consider the way that
you stole my comrade's lives.

398
00:21:24,821 --> 00:21:29,869
I stole nothing.
Actually, I saved them.

399
00:21:29,953 --> 00:21:33,270
Them and the children
they would've borne.

400
00:21:33,354 --> 00:21:37,336
Their deaths saved them
from this cruel world.

401
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,336
It looks like your legs
are starting to grow back.

402
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:45,084
Mr. Ksaver! I hope
you're still watching!

403
00:23:41,898 --> 00:23:44,480
The futures they seek are incompatible,

404
00:23:44,564 --> 00:23:47,014
so all they can do is clash.

405
00:23:47,098 --> 00:23:50,614
They fight for their beliefs
in the place where it all began.

406
00:23:50,698 --> 00:23:52,014
Shiganshina.

407
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:55,029
Next episode: "Above and Below."
