1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:07,676
So fight. Just fight.

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:09,676
What are you doing?

3
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:11,741
I mean you're clearly
muttering to yourself

4
00:00:11,825 --> 00:00:13,742
while staring at your reflection.

5
00:00:13,826 --> 00:00:16,410
But how come?
Ya just that bored? Or?

6
00:00:16,494 --> 00:00:20,142
Hey. You said, "So fight.
Just fight." Right?

7
00:00:20,226 --> 00:00:22,676
But when you say, "so fight, just fight,"

8
00:00:22,759 --> 00:00:24,342
who is it you're wanting to fight?

9
00:00:24,426 --> 00:00:26,742
I noticed that you said "fight" twice.

10
00:00:26,826 --> 00:00:28,276
Does that mean you'll fight two fights?

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,657
Or one fight with two rounds?

12
00:00:33,825 --> 00:00:36,142
Your silence isn't helping your case.

13
00:00:36,226 --> 00:00:37,542
I mean why would you talk to yourself

14
00:00:37,626 --> 00:00:39,676
but then ignore another person?

15
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:42,142
This doesn't seem normal at all to me.

16
00:00:42,226 --> 00:00:44,957
I've never chatted up my mirror before.

17
00:00:47,093 --> 00:00:50,142
But on a brighter note,
I'm loving your new hairstyle!

18
00:00:50,226 --> 00:00:52,542
Yeah. The disheveled look
makes a statement.

19
00:00:52,626 --> 00:00:54,741
It's like you can't be
bothered to deal with it,

20
00:00:54,825 --> 00:00:56,142
'cause you're busy working so hard...

21
00:00:56,226 --> 00:00:58,076
What did you come here to do?

22
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,542
What do you mean?
I came here to talk.

23
00:01:01,626 --> 00:01:02,476
The first time we met,

24
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:06,542
we spent all night talking
about Titans. Remember?

25
00:01:06,626 --> 00:01:09,276
Though looking back,
I guess you just listened

26
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,742
as I rambled about my research.

27
00:01:11,826 --> 00:01:14,276
I had faith in you.

28
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,190
I trusted that you would
never sacrifice Historia.

29
00:02:59,786 --> 00:03:02,968
Eren. It's been a year now.

30
00:03:03,052 --> 00:03:05,901
I haven't seen you since you
picked up our whole ship.

31
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:08,368
I look forward to working beside you.

32
00:03:08,452 --> 00:03:09,302
Too bad.

33
00:03:09,386 --> 00:03:11,901
You won't be working with Eren directly.

34
00:03:11,985 --> 00:03:14,835
This meeting is as far
as we're willing to go.

35
00:03:14,919 --> 00:03:17,368
More than enough for me.

36
00:03:17,452 --> 00:03:19,768
This is an auspicious day.

37
00:03:19,851 --> 00:03:21,636
The port's complete at last.

38
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,968
And we're about to welcome
our first foreign visitors.

39
00:03:25,052 --> 00:03:27,968
From the sole nation
that's friendly to Paradis.

40
00:03:28,052 --> 00:03:29,302
Hizuru.

41
00:03:29,386 --> 00:03:32,816
Their Special Envoy is Kiyomi Azumabito.

42
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,249
Do you happen to
recognize this family crest?

43
00:03:41,386 --> 00:03:41,968
That shape.

44
00:03:42,052 --> 00:03:43,568
Yeah. You should
show it to them.

45
00:03:43,652 --> 00:03:44,502
You think?

46
00:03:44,586 --> 00:03:47,368
But Mom told me that
I should keep it a secret.

47
00:03:47,452 --> 00:03:50,568
You showed it to me
back when we were just kids.

48
00:03:50,652 --> 00:03:54,517
This could be the whole reason
she gave it to you. Go on.

49
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:01,968
Before she died, my mom gave me this mark

50
00:04:02,052 --> 00:04:04,568
to match one she had herself.

51
00:04:04,652 --> 00:04:07,435
And she asked me to pass
it down to my own children.

52
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,502
A noble deed, befitting your lineage.

53
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,702
Over a century ago, Hizuru's shogun

54
00:04:14,785 --> 00:04:17,302
was an ally of the Eldian Empire.

55
00:04:17,386 --> 00:04:20,235
We Azumabitos trace our
lineage back to his son,

56
00:04:20,319 --> 00:04:21,702
who was on good terms with King Fritz,

57
00:04:21,785 --> 00:04:24,568
and often visited here.

58
00:04:24,652 --> 00:04:27,767
After the Great Titan War,
our once-proud nation

59
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,968
was left defeated and in disarray.

60
00:04:30,052 --> 00:04:32,436
And amidst the chaos and confusion,

61
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,568
a child fathered by the Shogun's heir

62
00:04:34,652 --> 00:04:38,235
was somehow left behind on this island.

63
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,568
You are the only direct
descendant of the family

64
00:04:40,652 --> 00:04:42,702
that once led our nation.

65
00:04:42,785 --> 00:04:45,483
Put simply, you are Hizuru's hope.

66
00:04:48,852 --> 00:04:50,702
They keep saying
the word "nation."

67
00:04:50,785 --> 00:04:52,436
I still don't understand it.

68
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,968
What matters is that this
gives us leverage over Hizuru.

69
00:04:56,052 --> 00:04:57,768
Unless it's a trap, that is.

70
00:04:57,852 --> 00:05:01,183
Right. Perhaps we
should ask Yelena's opinion.

71
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,901
No! That's exactly
what they want us to do.

72
00:05:05,985 --> 00:05:08,968
We're sure of one thing at least.

73
00:05:09,052 --> 00:05:12,302
In this world that our
new port has connected us to,

74
00:05:12,386 --> 00:05:15,968
we may as well be a tottering
child, learning to walk.

75
00:05:16,052 --> 00:05:18,302
For now, let's keep quiet

76
00:05:18,386 --> 00:05:21,436
and learn what we can from our guests.

77
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,502
Hey. So that symbol.

78
00:05:23,586 --> 00:05:25,968
Why'd you only show it to Eren?

79
00:05:26,052 --> 00:05:27,835
You've always worn that wristwrap.

80
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:29,968
I've never seen you take it off.

81
00:05:30,052 --> 00:05:31,568
That's because, um...

82
00:05:31,652 --> 00:05:33,368
Hey. You're in a good mood.

83
00:05:33,452 --> 00:05:35,302
Of course I am!

84
00:05:35,386 --> 00:05:36,901
Seems our ancestors were friends.

85
00:05:36,985 --> 00:05:39,968
They've left us both with
heavy burdens to bear.

86
00:05:40,052 --> 00:05:43,450
But I couldn't have asked for
a more perfect match than you.

87
00:05:48,452 --> 00:05:51,436
This is a historic day
for both our nations.

88
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,968
And it's worth noting that
this day would never have come

89
00:05:54,052 --> 00:05:56,768
if not for the man
who brought us together.

90
00:05:56,852 --> 00:05:59,835
I'm speaking, of course, of Zeke Jaeger.

91
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,368
We conversed with him in secret,

92
00:06:02,452 --> 00:06:04,968
and before he would agree
to facilitate this meeting,

93
00:06:05,052 --> 00:06:08,368
he negotiated with us
on behalf of your island.

94
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:10,749
We discussed more than Lady Mikasa.

95
00:06:11,785 --> 00:06:14,568
First of all.
Take a look at this.

96
00:06:14,651 --> 00:06:16,568
That's...!

97
00:06:16,651 --> 00:06:19,368
That's odd.
Do you recognize this?

98
00:06:19,452 --> 00:06:21,550
It's top secret in Marley.

99
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,502
Well, as you may know,

100
00:06:24,586 --> 00:06:26,701
this omni-directional mobility gear

101
00:06:26,785 --> 00:06:29,502
is an anti-Titan weapon made in Paradis.

102
00:06:29,586 --> 00:06:31,436
This piece doesn't belong to Marley.

103
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,635
I procured it myself.

104
00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:35,901
Please consider it a gift.

105
00:06:35,985 --> 00:06:36,968
I ought to mention though,

106
00:06:37,052 --> 00:06:40,768
it does need a special type
of fuel to operate.

107
00:06:40,852 --> 00:06:42,302
It's exceedingly rare.

108
00:06:42,386 --> 00:06:45,235
They're calling it
"Iceburst Stone."

109
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:47,235
It's only ever been mined in Paradis,

110
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:49,502
so very little is known about it.

111
00:06:49,586 --> 00:06:51,968
That said, you should be
able to find traces of it

112
00:06:52,052 --> 00:06:54,350
inside that apparatus.

113
00:06:55,586 --> 00:06:58,368
Zeke Jaeger's proposal
was that we ally with

114
00:06:58,452 --> 00:07:01,568
and assist Paradis in exchange
for access to a resource

115
00:07:01,651 --> 00:07:04,436
that could return our nation
to its former glory.

116
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,968
It's a rather tempting offer.

117
00:07:06,052 --> 00:07:08,368
Thus, while we're aware
that he made this offer

118
00:07:08,452 --> 00:07:10,968
without surveying your reserves,

119
00:07:11,052 --> 00:07:12,968
we suspect that in this modern era,

120
00:07:13,052 --> 00:07:16,368
a treasure like iceburst stone
could change the world

121
00:07:16,452 --> 00:07:19,968
and generate a fortune in the process.

122
00:07:20,052 --> 00:07:22,968
Sounds like that's Hizuru's real hope.

123
00:07:23,052 --> 00:07:25,502
Yelena did say that
negotiations would go well

124
00:07:25,585 --> 00:07:28,567
because the Azumabitos
are money grubbers.

125
00:07:28,651 --> 00:07:30,701
This is a dangerous island to visit.

126
00:07:30,785 --> 00:07:32,701
I doubt anyone would take the risk

127
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,436
if there weren't money to be made.

128
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,302
Hold on. So Zeke Jaeger
asked you to "assist us"?

129
00:07:39,386 --> 00:07:41,368
What would you assist us with?

130
00:07:41,452 --> 00:07:42,768
As I'm sure you're aware,

131
00:07:42,852 --> 00:07:45,701
he's concocted a plan to
protect Eldia and the world.

132
00:07:45,785 --> 00:07:47,968
We're here because
this plan can only succeed

133
00:07:48,052 --> 00:07:49,701
with Hizuru's assistance.

134
00:07:49,785 --> 00:07:51,701
It calls for a three-point
course of action

135
00:07:51,785 --> 00:07:53,768
which would allow you
to defend yourselves

136
00:07:53,852 --> 00:07:55,768
with your so-called "Rumbling."

137
00:07:55,852 --> 00:07:58,302
This would begin with
a test run of the Rumbling.

138
00:07:58,386 --> 00:08:00,902
You would unleash a fraction
of the Titans in your walls.

139
00:08:00,986 --> 00:08:03,302
Enough to display their
destructive potential

140
00:08:03,386 --> 00:08:05,302
for all the world to see.

141
00:08:05,386 --> 00:08:06,902
That will buy you time with which to

142
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,902
modernize and strengthen your army,

143
00:08:08,986 --> 00:08:11,502
so as to render the Rumbling unnecessary.

144
00:08:11,585 --> 00:08:13,902
You're a hundred years behind
the rest of the world.

145
00:08:13,986 --> 00:08:15,968
Hizuru will help you catch up.

146
00:08:16,052 --> 00:08:18,768
Until then, you must be
able to shake the earth

147
00:08:18,852 --> 00:08:20,701
by maintaining the Founding Titan

148
00:08:20,785 --> 00:08:23,567
and having a Titan of royal blood.

149
00:08:23,651 --> 00:08:25,568
That's the third point of this plan.

150
00:08:25,652 --> 00:08:28,302
Zeke will pass on the
Beast Titan to an individual

151
00:08:28,386 --> 00:08:29,968
who has royal blood.

152
00:08:30,052 --> 00:08:33,567
And that person must spend
the 13 years they'll have left

153
00:08:33,651 --> 00:08:36,501
bearing as many children as possible.

154
00:08:36,585 --> 00:08:38,701
Even if we get advanced weapons,

155
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:41,768
will we really stop needing the Rumbling?

156
00:08:41,852 --> 00:08:43,968
If we choose to rely on it,

157
00:08:44,052 --> 00:08:45,501
we'll have to continue the practice

158
00:08:45,585 --> 00:08:48,701
of Titan inheritance for generations.

159
00:08:48,785 --> 00:08:51,968
I see how it could protect us
for the time being,

160
00:08:52,052 --> 00:08:53,768
but is that enough of an excuse for us

161
00:08:53,852 --> 00:08:56,968
to push this problem
onto our descendants?

162
00:08:57,052 --> 00:08:59,768
Of course it isn't. And yet...

163
00:08:59,852 --> 00:09:02,436
I understand. And I'm ready.

164
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:05,302
If the Rumbling is
essential to our survival,

165
00:09:05,386 --> 00:09:06,501
I'll do my part.

166
00:09:06,585 --> 00:09:09,449
I'm willing to inherit the
Beast Titan from Zeke Jaeger.

167
00:09:15,585 --> 00:09:17,968
Historia.

168
00:09:18,052 --> 00:09:20,835
If Zeke's plan is to buy our salvation

169
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:23,968
at the price of broken walls,
trampled lands,

170
00:09:24,052 --> 00:09:27,501
and children bred to be
slaughtered like livestock,

171
00:09:27,585 --> 00:09:29,568
then I say he can go to hell

172
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,616
and take his sick little plan with him.

173
00:09:34,451 --> 00:09:36,501
Staking our survival on
the threat of the Rumbling

174
00:09:36,585 --> 00:09:38,302
is a dangerous move.

175
00:09:38,386 --> 00:09:40,435
So before we commit to it,

176
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:42,835
we should try to find another way.

177
00:09:42,919 --> 00:09:46,283
Let's use what time we have
to look at our options.

178
00:09:49,052 --> 00:09:52,768
I felt the same sense of
urgency that you did, Eren.

179
00:09:52,852 --> 00:09:56,236
That said, I still don't get
why you acted on your own.

180
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,568
You pushed our island into a war
we aren't ready to fight.

181
00:09:59,652 --> 00:10:02,568
Why? Did you stop
caring about Historia?

182
00:10:02,652 --> 00:10:04,782
I've taken the War Hammer Titan's power.

183
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:07,835
Its hardening ability

184
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:10,768
allows me to build
structures from thin air

185
00:10:10,852 --> 00:10:13,368
or carve them into earth and stone.

186
00:10:13,451 --> 00:10:15,501
Which means you can never build a prison

187
00:10:15,585 --> 00:10:18,702
deep or strong enough
to hold me in against my will.

188
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:22,236
I can leave this cell anytime I want.

189
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,902
And since I have the Founding Titan,

190
00:10:23,986 --> 00:10:25,768
you can't kill me.

191
00:10:25,852 --> 00:10:27,369
You might threaten to kill Zeke,

192
00:10:27,452 --> 00:10:29,568
but that's not a real option, either.

193
00:10:29,652 --> 00:10:32,302
So, tell me. Hange.

194
00:10:32,385 --> 00:10:34,582
Is there anything you actually can do?

195
00:10:36,652 --> 00:10:39,302
If you know something I don't,
then let's hear it.

196
00:10:39,385 --> 00:10:41,236
If you've got something up your sleeve,

197
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,350
then tell me what it is!

198
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:46,302
Hands off, you pervert!

199
00:10:46,385 --> 00:10:48,302
Ever the rebellious teen, huh?

200
00:10:48,385 --> 00:10:50,816
Grow up! Idiot.

201
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:58,302
Erwin.

202
00:10:58,385 --> 00:11:01,501
This is the one time
you bet on the wrong horse.

203
00:11:01,585 --> 00:11:04,416
Why did you ever think that
I could be Commander?

204
00:11:10,385 --> 00:11:12,968
Why don't you come in, Historia?

205
00:11:13,052 --> 00:11:15,649
You need to take better care of yourself.

206
00:11:24,819 --> 00:11:27,334
If no one else'll say it then I will.

207
00:11:27,418 --> 00:11:28,534
We should've stuck with our plan

208
00:11:28,618 --> 00:11:32,468
and fed Zeke to Historia
as soon as he got to the island.

209
00:11:32,552 --> 00:11:35,269
We'd all be safer if we had.

210
00:11:35,352 --> 00:11:39,202
Ha! But we let her do as she
pleased and so she got pregnant.

211
00:11:39,286 --> 00:11:40,668
Then again, what did we expect?

212
00:11:40,752 --> 00:11:43,468
I mean she's an upjumped bastard
who's queen in name alone.

213
00:11:43,552 --> 00:11:45,650
Hey! Quit it.

214
00:11:47,552 --> 00:11:50,534
The queen has every right
to choose a partner for herself.

215
00:11:50,618 --> 00:11:53,334
He's been checked out, so we
know he's not anyone's lackey.

216
00:11:53,418 --> 00:11:55,602
He's someone she knows.

217
00:11:55,686 --> 00:11:58,668
Apparently, they grew up
in the same area.

218
00:11:58,752 --> 00:12:00,069
As a kid, he'd throw rocks at the queen

219
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:02,534
because she wouldn't leave her farm.

220
00:12:02,618 --> 00:12:05,269
He must've wanted her to notice him.

221
00:12:05,352 --> 00:12:07,534
He said that when she
opened her orphanage,

222
00:12:07,618 --> 00:12:10,135
he started working there out of guilt.

223
00:12:10,219 --> 00:12:11,735
I believe him.

224
00:12:11,819 --> 00:12:15,334
He worked hard and kept his
head down for years there.

225
00:12:15,418 --> 00:12:17,668
She approached him, in the end.

226
00:12:17,752 --> 00:12:20,135
I don't give a damn
about their love story!

227
00:12:20,219 --> 00:12:21,602
Look. What I'm concerned about

228
00:12:21,686 --> 00:12:23,602
is why the girl selfishly decided to

229
00:12:23,686 --> 00:12:26,268
get herself knocked up when she did!

230
00:12:26,352 --> 00:12:28,334
And I think I've got a good guess.

231
00:12:28,418 --> 00:12:30,135
Somebody told her that it would stop us

232
00:12:30,219 --> 00:12:31,735
from turning her into a Titan.

233
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:34,202
I bet it was that turncoat, Yelena.

234
00:12:34,285 --> 00:12:37,002
The giantess is nuts,
but she's smart, too,

235
00:12:37,086 --> 00:12:39,268
and that's a dangerous combination.

236
00:12:39,352 --> 00:12:41,002
"Just put a baby in the queen

237
00:12:41,086 --> 00:12:43,069
and Zeke Jaeger gets
to live another day!"

238
00:12:43,153 --> 00:12:45,268
Roeg. You've had too much.

239
00:12:45,352 --> 00:12:47,334
If we were smart, we'd still do it.

240
00:12:47,418 --> 00:12:50,268
Turn her into a Titan whether
she's pregnant or not.

241
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,735
That would probably kill the child.

242
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:56,135
And if miscarrying kills
the queen, too, we're doomed.

243
00:12:56,219 --> 00:12:57,135
It's too risky.

244
00:12:57,219 --> 00:13:00,268
Giving birth poses a threat
to her life as it is.

245
00:13:00,352 --> 00:13:01,735
That's a perfectly sound argument

246
00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:05,135
that could bring our country to ruin.

247
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:08,069
Hey! Marleyan!
Get us another bottle!

248
00:13:08,153 --> 00:13:09,583
As you wish, sir.

249
00:13:10,686 --> 00:13:11,983
Greiz.

250
00:13:13,218 --> 00:13:14,468
Nicolo.

251
00:13:14,552 --> 00:13:17,150
You should recommend this one.

252
00:13:21,819 --> 00:13:26,468
Hey! Is this really

253
00:13:26,552 --> 00:13:29,468
something they needed us to do?

254
00:13:29,552 --> 00:13:33,002
Nope! They'd've
hired someone...

255
00:13:33,086 --> 00:13:36,668
If that idiot hadn't opened his
mouth and volunteered our help.

256
00:13:36,752 --> 00:13:38,468
"We can develop the
island and our muscles

257
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:41,668
at the same time," my ass.

258
00:13:41,752 --> 00:13:43,468
Well we don't have much else to do,

259
00:13:43,552 --> 00:13:46,069
except wait for Hizuru's answer.

260
00:13:46,153 --> 00:13:48,602
Uh-huh. Hopefully,
with their help,

261
00:13:48,686 --> 00:13:51,534
we can win some friends in this world.

262
00:13:51,618 --> 00:13:52,468
It might be a long shot,

263
00:13:52,552 --> 00:13:55,135
but it could be an
alternative to the Rumbling.

264
00:13:55,218 --> 00:13:57,516
And that could save
Historia from suffering.

265
00:13:59,153 --> 00:14:01,150
Hey!

266
00:14:04,086 --> 00:14:06,135
Phew! It can't be easy,

267
00:14:06,218 --> 00:14:08,268
working your butts off
when it's this hot out.

268
00:14:08,352 --> 00:14:09,334
Yeah, well.

269
00:14:09,418 --> 00:14:12,069
We have to be here to
watch over this moron, right?

270
00:14:12,153 --> 00:14:13,735
You brats got taller.

271
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:16,468
It's like you're sprouting up
just to spite me.

272
00:14:16,552 --> 00:14:18,069
Hear anything from Hizuru yet?

273
00:14:18,152 --> 00:14:20,268
That's why we're here.
The Azumabitos replied.

274
00:14:20,352 --> 00:14:22,468
What'd they say?

275
00:14:22,552 --> 00:14:23,735
It's no good.

276
00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:26,983
Hizuru either can't or
won't help us with this.

277
00:14:27,752 --> 00:14:30,002
Makes sense.
Hizuru has a monopoly

278
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:32,668
on any resources that we
want to export right now,

279
00:14:32,752 --> 00:14:35,735
so why would they ever help us
trade with other countries?

280
00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:38,402
From what I hear,
the world's major powers

281
00:14:38,486 --> 00:14:41,134
want Paradis to be the root of all evil.

282
00:14:41,218 --> 00:14:43,468
We're the shared foe that
helps brings them together.

283
00:14:43,552 --> 00:14:46,616
Their hatred for us
promotes global stability.

284
00:14:48,819 --> 00:14:53,334
Then... do we have to
rely on the Rumbling?

285
00:14:53,418 --> 00:14:57,069
Do we have no choice
but to sacrifice Historia?

286
00:14:57,152 --> 00:14:58,134
That's right.

287
00:14:58,218 --> 00:15:01,334
So what? The world's
decided that we're devils,

288
00:15:01,418 --> 00:15:04,134
regardless of what our intentions are?

289
00:15:04,218 --> 00:15:05,668
They can't want us to repeat the past,

290
00:15:05,752 --> 00:15:08,283
so why won't they consider peace?

291
00:15:08,953 --> 00:15:13,069
Probably 'cause they don't know better.

292
00:15:13,152 --> 00:15:16,668
They don't know anything about
us and that makes them afraid.

293
00:15:16,752 --> 00:15:19,268
I agree. Our neighbors
across the sea

294
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:22,268
won't trust people whose
faces they've never seen.

295
00:15:22,352 --> 00:15:24,069
So let's sail out and meet 'em!

296
00:15:24,152 --> 00:15:25,735
If they don't know anything about us,

297
00:15:25,819 --> 00:15:27,567
then we'll just have to teach them!

298
00:15:28,352 --> 00:15:32,016
That's what we Scouts always do, right?

299
00:15:32,686 --> 00:15:34,468
So the plan is to infiltrate Marley

300
00:15:34,552 --> 00:15:36,268
and set up a base there, huh?

301
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,535
I like it.

302
00:15:37,619 --> 00:15:40,002
Hange has a plan
for everything, am I right?

303
00:15:40,085 --> 00:15:41,134
It's exciting.

304
00:15:41,218 --> 00:15:43,468
We'll all get to chow down
on food from a distant land.

305
00:15:43,552 --> 00:15:46,334
Yeah. Wonder what
we should pack.

306
00:15:46,418 --> 00:15:49,268
Hope that foreign food
doesn't give us the runs.

307
00:15:49,352 --> 00:15:51,468
We'll need to pack some
antacids, a toothbrush,

308
00:15:51,552 --> 00:15:52,668
and a taste of home.

309
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:55,468
Did you even hear Hange's plan?

310
00:15:55,552 --> 00:15:57,602
If we can just find a way
to convince the world

311
00:15:57,686 --> 00:16:01,616
that all we want is peace,
maybe our situation'll change.

312
00:16:06,753 --> 00:16:09,268
If we only had a little more time left.

313
00:16:09,352 --> 00:16:12,669
My time will be up
in just over five years.

314
00:16:12,753 --> 00:16:15,535
We need to make a decision soon.

315
00:16:15,619 --> 00:16:17,950
About who to give my Titan to.

316
00:16:19,753 --> 00:16:21,402
I think it should be me.

317
00:16:21,486 --> 00:16:23,402
No. Not an option.

318
00:16:23,486 --> 00:16:24,735
We don't even know if Ackermanns're

319
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:26,669
able to turn into Titans.

320
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:29,535
And even if you could, Hizuru
would be furious about it.

321
00:16:29,619 --> 00:16:31,735
You're their long-lost heir, remember?

322
00:16:31,819 --> 00:16:34,268
It can't be you for more
reasons than I can count.

323
00:16:34,352 --> 00:16:36,068
Who do you think it should be?

324
00:16:36,152 --> 00:16:37,668
This guy.

325
00:16:37,752 --> 00:16:40,602
First of all, I'm a whole lot
smarter than Eren.

326
00:16:40,686 --> 00:16:43,468
We'd replace this suicidal
maniac with a gifted leader

327
00:16:43,552 --> 00:16:46,134
who shows good judgment
in all situations.

328
00:16:46,218 --> 00:16:50,268
A rare specimen who can perform
whatever duty is required.

329
00:16:50,352 --> 00:16:53,134
I don't much like
getting his hand-me-downs,

330
00:16:53,218 --> 00:16:55,535
but hey, I'm the best
candidate we've got.

331
00:16:55,619 --> 00:16:57,334
Sure, except we
can't afford to lose someone

332
00:16:57,418 --> 00:17:00,468
that valuable after just 13 years, moron.

333
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:01,735
Ha?

334
00:17:01,819 --> 00:17:04,535
You should aim to become
the regiment's next commander.

335
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:07,134
I'll inherit Eren's Titan myself.

336
00:17:07,218 --> 00:17:09,669
Yeah. That should work. Right?

337
00:17:09,753 --> 00:17:10,935
Conny.

338
00:17:11,018 --> 00:17:14,535
No, that won't work at all.
You're way too much of an idiot.

339
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:15,668
Eh?

340
00:17:15,752 --> 00:17:19,068
Use your head, Conny.
This is a really important duty.

341
00:17:19,152 --> 00:17:22,268
We can't entrust it to someone
who's slow, like you.

342
00:17:22,352 --> 00:17:23,268
Huh?

343
00:17:23,352 --> 00:17:26,535
Ya really get my goat sometimes.

344
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:28,602
I'll inherit it, okay?

345
00:17:28,686 --> 00:17:30,134
I'm an experienced veteran,

346
00:17:30,218 --> 00:17:32,535
and I've proven that I'm
someone you can rely on.

347
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:35,669
By process of elimination,
you've gotta use me.

348
00:17:35,753 --> 00:17:36,935
You guys...

349
00:17:37,018 --> 00:17:40,268
I get that I have to, but still,
I really don't wanna.

350
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:43,735
Sasha. Wait.
You're not making any sense.

351
00:17:43,819 --> 00:17:44,669
Huh?

352
00:17:44,753 --> 00:17:46,535
I mean, you know.

353
00:17:46,619 --> 00:17:48,669
We can't give his Titan to an idiot.

354
00:17:48,753 --> 00:17:50,483
You just told me that.

355
00:17:51,753 --> 00:17:52,669
But think.

356
00:17:52,753 --> 00:17:55,134
You're more of an idiot
than me, which means,

357
00:17:55,218 --> 00:17:57,450
you just contradicted yourself, right?

358
00:17:58,753 --> 00:17:59,650
Huh?

359
00:18:00,753 --> 00:18:02,602
Huh?

360
00:18:02,686 --> 00:18:06,468
I'm not planning on
handing it down to any of you.

361
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,268
Why not?

362
00:18:08,352 --> 00:18:10,468
Because you're important to me.

363
00:18:10,552 --> 00:18:12,669
More than anyone else.

364
00:18:12,753 --> 00:18:16,483
I hope...
you'll live long lives.

365
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:35,068
Ha?! Hold on!
What are you turning red for?

366
00:18:35,152 --> 00:18:37,535
The hell kinda mood are
you trying to set here?

367
00:18:37,619 --> 00:18:39,068
Sorry.

368
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:42,268
Jean. It's just the sunset.

369
00:18:42,352 --> 00:18:45,068
That's what's making our faces red.

370
00:18:45,152 --> 00:18:47,335
Oh. Right. That makes sense.

371
00:18:47,419 --> 00:18:49,183
There's nothing to be done, then.

372
00:19:07,552 --> 00:19:10,068
So Pyxis detained the volunteers?

373
00:19:10,152 --> 00:19:11,735
Such a strong-arm tactic.

374
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:14,268
It's hard to believe he'd go that far.

375
00:19:14,352 --> 00:19:16,068
They had built good working relationships

376
00:19:16,152 --> 00:19:17,268
with a lot of us Scouts,

377
00:19:17,352 --> 00:19:20,068
so our regiment wasn't
notified in advance.

378
00:19:20,152 --> 00:19:23,335
That said, I doubt Pyxis had much choice,

379
00:19:23,419 --> 00:19:26,469
'cause until we understand
Zeke's real intentions,

380
00:19:26,553 --> 00:19:29,669
his presence here
puts us in a tough spot.

381
00:19:29,753 --> 00:19:33,134
I wonder what made Eren
decide to go with his plan.

382
00:19:33,218 --> 00:19:36,535
Him and Zeke must've talked,
but what was said...

383
00:19:36,619 --> 00:19:39,669
Well, no one knows except for them.

384
00:19:39,753 --> 00:19:42,469
Hey. Did that guy look like Eren

385
00:19:42,553 --> 00:19:44,535
when you all saw him?

386
00:19:44,619 --> 00:19:48,134
'Cause if you ask me, that wasn't Eren.

387
00:19:48,218 --> 00:19:50,068
And if whoever that was

388
00:19:50,152 --> 00:19:53,283
is capable of picking his
half-brother over us, then...

389
00:19:54,352 --> 00:19:57,068
If he is, then what?

390
00:19:57,152 --> 00:19:58,669
Then I say we'll need to be prepared to

391
00:19:58,753 --> 00:20:00,335
cut him down ourselves if necessary...

392
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:02,049
I won't let you!

393
00:20:05,152 --> 00:20:08,134
Are you taking their side,
too, Mikasa? Come on.

394
00:20:08,218 --> 00:20:12,283
I don't think it'll come to that.

395
00:20:13,018 --> 00:20:16,335
Eren cares about us
more than anyone else.

396
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:18,450
Everyone here should know that.

397
00:20:22,553 --> 00:20:25,402
Maybe that's why he's become so combative

398
00:20:25,486 --> 00:20:28,135
towards anyone who isn't one of us.

399
00:20:28,219 --> 00:20:30,468
It's because his feelings are so strong.

400
00:20:30,552 --> 00:20:32,202
No, that isn't it.

401
00:20:32,286 --> 00:20:33,735
He's always seen your strength,

402
00:20:33,818 --> 00:20:35,669
but the Eren that we used to know

403
00:20:35,753 --> 00:20:39,335
would still try to keep you
away from the front lines.

404
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:41,202
But he used you in that battle.

405
00:20:41,286 --> 00:20:44,268
Sent Armin to destroy that port.

406
00:20:44,352 --> 00:20:46,268
He called the rest of us important, too,

407
00:20:46,352 --> 00:20:48,068
and he used us just the same.

408
00:20:48,152 --> 00:20:51,268
But maybe that's
just because he trusts us.

409
00:20:51,352 --> 00:20:55,402
I mean, if we hadn't helped him,
his plan would've failed.

410
00:20:55,486 --> 00:20:58,469
Yeah, and Sasha would be alive right now.

411
00:20:58,553 --> 00:21:04,068
Hey. What do you think Eren did
when I told him she had died?

412
00:21:04,152 --> 00:21:05,735
Do you think he cried?

413
00:21:05,818 --> 00:21:08,068
Or showed some regret maybe?

414
00:21:08,152 --> 00:21:09,669
Conny. Stop.

415
00:21:09,752 --> 00:21:11,083
The bastard laughed.

416
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:16,134
I wonder what part of our
friend's death that it was

417
00:21:16,218 --> 00:21:19,402
that he found so damn amusing.

418
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,535
Why don't you explain, Mikasa?

419
00:21:21,619 --> 00:21:24,135
Why did Eren start laughing?

420
00:21:24,219 --> 00:21:28,150
You know everything
about him. Right?

421
00:21:29,553 --> 00:21:31,335
We need to talk to him.

422
00:21:31,419 --> 00:21:33,669
Just Eren, Mikasa, and me.

423
00:21:33,752 --> 00:21:36,068
We'll give him a chance
to explain his goal.

424
00:21:36,152 --> 00:21:37,734
Are you sure that'll help?

425
00:21:37,818 --> 00:21:41,383
Tell me, what if his goals
are the same as Zeke's?

426
00:21:42,752 --> 00:21:45,068
The volunteers gave us Titan serum,

427
00:21:45,152 --> 00:21:47,135
so we have a choice now.

428
00:21:47,219 --> 00:21:48,669
Wait, what are you saying?

429
00:21:48,752 --> 00:21:50,402
We can choose to turn someone

430
00:21:50,486 --> 00:21:53,335
who we can trust into a Titan,

431
00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:56,617
and then have them inherit
the Founder from Eren.

432
00:22:56,332 --> 00:22:57,630
Good stuff.

433
00:23:41,332 --> 00:23:44,248
Gabi and Falco escape from their cell.

434
00:23:44,332 --> 00:23:47,248
They wander, lost and alone,
through the wilderness,

435
00:23:47,332 --> 00:23:49,914
till they find themselves
saved by one of the devils

436
00:23:49,998 --> 00:23:52,182
they've been taught to hate.

437
00:23:52,266 --> 00:23:54,863
Next episode: "Deceiver."
