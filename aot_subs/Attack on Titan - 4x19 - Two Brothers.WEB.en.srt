Why isn't Ymir obeying me?

waiting for you to wake up,

265
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,500
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd"><font size="55">I learned quite a bit.

266
00:20:33,290 --> 00:20:36,290
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd"><font size="55">I learned that the Founder
can make anything.

into these chains.

<font face="Noto Sans SemBd"><font size="55">But only by the will of a person
with royal blood, like me.

269
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,720
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd"><font size="55">And unlike the
Kings of the Walls

272

of the first King.

<font face="Noto Sans SemBd"><font size="55">I spent here with the Founder
waiting for you to wake up,

275
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:03,490
<font face="Noto Sans SemBd"><font size="55">I discovered a way to nullify
the vow renouncing war.

almost anything you can imagine,

277

she lacks the will

<font face="Noto Sans SemBd"><font size="55">to exercise that
power for herself.

orders without question.

281
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:22,500

power is mine alone.

your true feelings,

288
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,690

of a father who

his brainwashing,
