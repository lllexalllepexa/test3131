1
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:05,519
Well, Dad needs to get going.

2
00:00:05,603 --> 00:00:08,252
I want you to try and
stay out of trouble for me.

3
00:00:08,336 --> 00:00:09,635
Listen to your big sister.

4
00:00:12,536 --> 00:00:13,852
I wanna go with you!

5
00:00:13,936 --> 00:00:15,533
Yeah bring us with you!

6
00:00:17,536 --> 00:00:21,466
I'm so sorry, but no. I can't.

7
00:00:25,536 --> 00:00:28,452
Hey! Stop acting so selfish
and behave yourselves.

8
00:00:28,536 --> 00:00:30,586
You're making this harder for him.

9
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:35,399
Fine. Try and
help them to get along.

10
00:00:36,069 --> 00:00:37,786
I will! Good luck
with your work!

11
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:41,852
Thanks. All right. Goodbye.

12
00:00:41,936 --> 00:00:44,452
See you soon!

13
00:00:44,536 --> 00:00:45,634
Darling...

14
00:00:49,336 --> 00:00:52,334
I'm sorry.
Take care of the kids.

15
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,534
Let's go.

16
00:01:04,336 --> 00:01:06,452
Right. So, if they attack,

17
00:01:06,536 --> 00:01:08,586
they'll do it during my speech, yes?

18
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,452
Nothing's guaranteed, sir,

19
00:01:10,536 --> 00:01:13,185
but that seems like
the strongest possibility.

20
00:01:13,269 --> 00:01:15,252
Most of Marley's highest ranked officers

21
00:01:15,336 --> 00:01:16,386
will be gathered for it.

22
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,185
That's a rare occurrence.

23
00:01:18,269 --> 00:01:20,586
I should mention,
in accordance with protocol,

24
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:22,786
we're waiting to determine
escape routes till later,

25
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:24,652
lest the information should leak.

26
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,786
I'll note that many VIPs
will be arriving by carriage.

27
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:31,652
Got it. Seat the officers
in a special section.

28
00:01:31,736 --> 00:01:34,567
Group them, preferably at
the edge of the crowd.

29
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:38,586
Is this really what you want to do, sir?

30
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,119
We Tyburs haven't just
sat around enjoying ourselves.

31
00:01:42,203 --> 00:01:44,319
At least this generation hasn't.

32
00:01:44,403 --> 00:01:45,386
We've been at work.

33
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,319
Fostering relationships
with the world's ruling class.

34
00:01:48,403 --> 00:01:50,852
Improving people's
perceptions of Eldians,

35
00:01:50,936 --> 00:01:54,133
and keeping track of
events on Paradis Island.

36
00:01:55,069 --> 00:01:59,252
That said, we neglected
to watch our backs.

37
00:01:59,336 --> 00:02:02,452
Before we knew it, our enemies
had crossed the sea,

38
00:02:02,536 --> 00:02:04,386
when they were at our necks.

39
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:06,452
I fear that we could
find our throats slashed

40
00:02:06,536 --> 00:02:08,319
at any moment now.

41
00:02:08,403 --> 00:02:10,652
It's become clear that
the infiltrators received help

42
00:02:10,736 --> 00:02:13,786
from within Marley,
and the unsettling truth is

43
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,586
that we still don't know who gave it.

44
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:19,652
As you surely know,
our motherland, Marley,

45
00:02:19,736 --> 00:02:21,452
has many enemies.

46
00:02:21,536 --> 00:02:23,786
Even within our own military.

47
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:25,786
And if you want to
smoke out your enemies,

48
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:28,252
you light a fire beneath them.

49
00:02:28,336 --> 00:02:30,720
We know when and where
the foe intends to attack us.

50
00:02:30,804 --> 00:02:33,133
That ought to give us the advantage.

51
00:02:34,069 --> 00:02:38,067
Unless you have a better one,
this is the plan.

52
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,386
Even if we can predict their moves,

53
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:43,586
we're putting far too much at stake.

54
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:46,386
We're sacrificing incompetent officers.

55
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,852
If the enemy's goal is to damage
our military, then so be it.

56
00:02:49,935 --> 00:02:52,319
This is an opportunity.

57
00:02:52,403 --> 00:02:54,252
Start picking replacements now.

58
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,786
The party will approve anyone you choose

59
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:58,185
for your reformed military.

60
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:01,186
But, sir, so many will die.

61
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,386
And most will be Eldian civilians.

62
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,567
They're spawn of the devil, aren't they?

63
00:03:09,869 --> 00:03:13,319
Don't change on me now, Commander.

64
00:03:13,403 --> 00:03:15,519
You've ordered countless
Eldians up and over

65
00:03:15,603 --> 00:03:17,386
to meet their deaths in a hellscape

66
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,386
of barbed wire, landmines, and bullets.

67
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,586
So these ones won't be wearing uniforms.

68
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,386
That changes nothing.

69
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:27,067
You just need to keep doing
what you've always done.

70
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,786
Allow me to say one thing.

71
00:03:32,869 --> 00:03:34,452
This isn't a war.

72
00:03:34,536 --> 00:03:36,252
We don't know our enemies, their goals,

73
00:03:36,336 --> 00:03:38,252
or how they plan to attack us.

74
00:03:38,336 --> 00:03:39,319
When they make their move,

75
00:03:39,403 --> 00:03:42,467
the crowd surrounding you
will erupt in chaos.

76
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,852
Lord Tybur.

77
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:50,851
If we go forward with this,
and use you to bait the enemy,

78
00:03:50,935 --> 00:03:53,786
I doubt I'll be able to protect you.

79
00:03:53,869 --> 00:03:57,300
They'll do whatever it takes
to make sure that you die.

80
00:04:00,804 --> 00:04:04,786
Of course.
I'm prepared for that.

81
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:08,652
Unless I stand on that stage,
the world will not take notice.

82
00:04:08,736 --> 00:04:10,386
There must be officers, ambassadors,

83
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:13,567
and journalists from around
the globe in that audience.

84
00:04:14,803 --> 00:04:16,186
And crucially,

85
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:18,252
the Eldian civilians who are killed,

86
00:04:18,336 --> 00:04:21,701
myself included, must be mourned by all.

87
00:04:24,203 --> 00:04:27,119
As victims of an
"unforeseen attack."

88
00:04:27,203 --> 00:04:30,452
If I escaped while
my people died en masse,

89
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:33,134
the world would not rally to our cause.

90
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:44,252
I fully believe the Eldian race
was spawned by the devil.

91
00:04:44,336 --> 00:04:49,300
But I'm just as sure that
we're devils ourselves.

92
00:07:08,792 --> 00:07:11,174
Gabi! Udo! Get up!

93
00:07:11,258 --> 00:07:12,989
On your feet! Hurry!

94
00:07:13,991 --> 00:07:18,089
Huh...? Zofia...?

95
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:23,107
- -Zofia, no! Zofia!
- -Udo, you can't!

96
00:07:23,191 --> 00:07:24,689
- -Zofia!
- -Listen to me!

97
00:07:25,991 --> 00:07:27,974
Come and help me!
We have to lift this...

98
00:07:28,058 --> 00:07:29,122
Udo!

99
00:07:49,726 --> 00:07:53,508
You've fulfilled your
duty as a Tybur, brother.

100
00:07:53,592 --> 00:07:55,656
I'm so proud of you.

101
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:21,974
Commander Magath!

102
00:08:22,058 --> 00:08:24,107
The War Hammer Titan
is getting pulverized!

103
00:08:24,191 --> 00:08:25,708
Commander! The Warrior
Unit's gone silent!

104
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:27,907
General Calvi and the rest
of the brass are dead, sir!

105
00:08:27,991 --> 00:08:28,774
Should we start evacuating...

106
00:08:28,858 --> 00:08:30,107
We have to fall back before we're killed!

107
00:08:30,191 --> 00:08:31,174
We need orders!

108
00:08:31,258 --> 00:08:32,456
Commander!

109
00:08:34,991 --> 00:08:36,974
Commander?

110
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,508
It was a harmless plink,

111
00:08:38,592 --> 00:08:40,574
but the first shot has now been fired.

112
00:08:40,658 --> 00:08:42,907
Our counterattack's begun.

113
00:08:42,991 --> 00:08:45,842
I never thought they'd
make such a grand entrance.

114
00:08:45,925 --> 00:08:48,441
What's more, that looks to be the usurper

115
00:08:48,525 --> 00:08:50,574
of the Founding Titan down there.

116
00:08:50,658 --> 00:08:52,055
The Attack Titan.

117
00:08:52,858 --> 00:08:55,855
We're up against Eren Jaeger himself.

118
00:08:57,258 --> 00:08:59,642
Just means he's saved us
a trip to the island.

119
00:08:59,726 --> 00:09:02,642
Get in position, men!
Prepare for battle!

120
00:09:02,726 --> 00:09:03,855
Understood, sir!

121
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,574
Sheesh, what's all this commotion about?

122
00:09:22,658 --> 00:09:24,889
Don't just stand there!
We have to run...

123
00:09:33,058 --> 00:09:34,841
Now, I don't want any of you forgetting.

124
00:09:34,925 --> 00:09:38,055
The first attack that pierced
the enemy came from my gun.

125
00:09:43,058 --> 00:09:44,774
Shit! What is this?

126
00:09:44,857 --> 00:09:46,574
The whole town's like a battlefield!

127
00:09:46,658 --> 00:09:48,556
Is he okay?

128
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,907
No. We need to
get him to the hospital.

129
00:09:53,991 --> 00:09:57,642
Oh no. Udo.

130
00:09:57,726 --> 00:09:59,174
What the hell?

131
00:09:59,258 --> 00:10:02,556
Falco! Where are you?

132
00:10:06,525 --> 00:10:08,642
Okay. What's going on here?

133
00:10:08,726 --> 00:10:10,574
Based on all the tremors,

134
00:10:10,658 --> 00:10:13,441
I think Titans must be
fighting on the surface.

135
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:15,174
Wait, are you serious?

136
00:10:15,258 --> 00:10:16,841
You have to admit that it would explain

137
00:10:16,925 --> 00:10:18,974
why that soldier trapped us down here.

138
00:10:19,058 --> 00:10:20,974
We need to join the fight quickly.

139
00:10:21,058 --> 00:10:21,988
But how?

140
00:10:23,258 --> 00:10:24,174
What the hell?

141
00:10:24,258 --> 00:10:24,907
You're late!

142
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,974
- -Sorry, Pieck!
- -Are you two okay?

143
00:10:27,058 --> 00:10:28,708
Yeah! Throw us a rope!

144
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:29,775
On it!

145
00:10:29,858 --> 00:10:32,642
The Panzer Unit. How'd they
know we'd be here?

146
00:10:32,726 --> 00:10:34,174
I thought Beardy looked suspicious,

147
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,508
so I told them to follow us.

148
00:10:36,592 --> 00:10:37,974
Back then?

149
00:10:38,058 --> 00:10:40,107
There's something up with this soldier.

150
00:10:40,191 --> 00:10:42,174
Shadow us for a while.

151
00:10:42,258 --> 00:10:43,907
A Titan attacked and killed Lord Tybur

152
00:10:43,991 --> 00:10:44,974
during his speech!

153
00:10:45,058 --> 00:10:45,974
For real?

154
00:10:46,058 --> 00:10:47,642
The War Hammer Titan's
keeping it occupied

155
00:10:47,726 --> 00:10:48,907
for the time being.

156
00:10:48,991 --> 00:10:50,508
How far to the Cart's armor?

157
00:10:50,592 --> 00:10:51,708
It's back at HQ!

158
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,107
We can equip it in 15 minutes.

159
00:10:53,191 --> 00:10:54,107
Do it in ten.

160
00:10:54,191 --> 00:10:55,107
Roger that.

161
00:10:55,191 --> 00:10:56,574
I'm going on ahead.

162
00:10:56,658 --> 00:10:57,574
Hold on, Porco.

163
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:59,508
Don't rush in till you know what you're...

164
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,708
What the...?

165
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:03,574
There's no way.

166
00:11:03,658 --> 00:11:04,989
How'd they get here?

167
00:11:48,857 --> 00:11:49,508
We hit it!

168
00:11:49,592 --> 00:11:50,774
Yeah, take that!

169
00:11:50,858 --> 00:11:52,108
These Anti-Titan cannons pack a punch!

170
00:11:52,192 --> 00:11:53,108
This is our chance.

171
00:11:53,192 --> 00:11:55,707
We can finish off Eren Jaeger
here and now.

172
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:58,508
If we strip them of the Founding
Titan, they're finished!

173
00:11:58,592 --> 00:11:59,707
- -Not so.
- -Huh?

174
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:00,974
If we kill the Founder,

175
00:12:01,058 --> 00:12:02,974
it will only postpone the problem.

176
00:12:03,058 --> 00:12:06,174
What we need is to have
the War Hammer Titan eat it!

177
00:12:06,258 --> 00:12:09,108
Our mission is to make sure that happens.

178
00:12:09,192 --> 00:12:11,442
Right. But, sir. It's just...

179
00:12:11,526 --> 00:12:12,974
It doesn't actually
look like the War Hammer's

180
00:12:13,058 --> 00:12:14,855
trying to eat it.

181
00:12:24,592 --> 00:12:25,442
Look at that!

182
00:12:25,526 --> 00:12:26,508
The War Hammer's a monster!

183
00:12:26,592 --> 00:12:28,174
It beat the Attack Titan!

184
00:12:28,258 --> 00:12:30,523
The War Hammer wins!

185
00:12:36,192 --> 00:12:39,356
That's him. Eren Jaeger.

186
00:12:46,592 --> 00:12:50,556
It... It's gonna finish him off!

187
00:12:52,592 --> 00:12:56,174
Usurper Eren Jaeger.

188
00:12:56,258 --> 00:13:00,022
Before you die, you may
utter your final words.

189
00:13:08,858 --> 00:13:10,755
It's time, Mikasa.

190
00:13:50,258 --> 00:13:52,556
Glad to see that all of you made it.

191
00:13:53,658 --> 00:13:57,556
Please. Eren. Come home.

192
00:14:06,551 --> 00:14:08,467
Our chain of command has been shattered.

193
00:14:08,551 --> 00:14:11,467
This is the ultimate test
of our military's strength.

194
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:14,067
Cancel the special
vigilance training at once.

195
00:14:14,151 --> 00:14:17,067
Bring that entire division
down from the mountains.

196
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:18,267
Call in the fleet as well.

197
00:14:18,351 --> 00:14:20,001
And bring in all 30,000 soldiers

198
00:14:20,085 --> 00:14:22,267
we have stationed to the east and west.

199
00:14:22,351 --> 00:14:25,467
I want the Internment Zone
sealed off! Surround us.

200
00:14:25,551 --> 00:14:27,467
Don't let a single Island Devil escape,

201
00:14:27,551 --> 00:14:29,348
especially not the Founder!

202
00:14:32,418 --> 00:14:35,134
Go ahead and wreak havoc while you can.

203
00:14:35,218 --> 00:14:37,067
Your fates are sealed.

204
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,601
This has gone exactly as Willy planned.

205
00:14:39,685 --> 00:14:43,334
The entire world now considers
the Eldian Empire a threat.

206
00:14:43,418 --> 00:14:45,467
And every nation that
lost government officials

207
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:49,401
to this massacre is
now a party to this war.

208
00:14:49,485 --> 00:14:53,734
This world can no longer
risk letting you live.

209
00:14:53,818 --> 00:14:58,067
But, you must've realized
that going into this.

210
00:14:58,150 --> 00:14:59,682
Which means...

211
00:15:09,218 --> 00:15:10,467
Damn devils!

212
00:15:10,551 --> 00:15:12,515
Fight! Shoot!

213
00:15:18,218 --> 00:15:19,667
Idiots.

214
00:15:19,751 --> 00:15:23,200
Hey! Are you trying to burn down
the whole Internment Zone?

215
00:15:23,284 --> 00:15:26,467
We need to try to keep civilian
casualties to a minimum.

216
00:15:26,551 --> 00:15:28,401
Understand me, Floch?

217
00:15:28,485 --> 00:15:30,400
Everyone here is an enemy.

218
00:15:30,484 --> 00:15:32,401
These are just our enemy's homes.

219
00:15:32,485 --> 00:15:34,200
Don't forget what they did to us.

220
00:15:34,284 --> 00:15:35,667
The Titans who've been
slaughtering our people

221
00:15:35,751 --> 00:15:37,401
for years came from here, right?

222
00:15:37,485 --> 00:15:39,200
They've been eating us alive!

223
00:15:39,284 --> 00:15:41,200
So they've got this coming and then some!

224
00:15:41,284 --> 00:15:43,200
Seriously, you have to
stop thinking like that.

225
00:15:43,284 --> 00:15:46,067
Look there.
He's telling us something.

226
00:15:46,151 --> 00:15:47,801
That we have to fight.

227
00:15:47,885 --> 00:15:49,601
We can't just cower behind our walls,

228
00:15:49,685 --> 00:15:51,467
waiting for death to come.

229
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,267
We need to fight like he does.

230
00:15:53,351 --> 00:15:55,400
Like devils.

231
00:15:55,484 --> 00:15:58,467
Hey. Eren.

232
00:15:58,551 --> 00:16:01,615
You understand what
you've done, don't you?

233
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:08,401
You've killed so many civilians.

234
00:16:08,485 --> 00:16:11,449
Innocent people. Kids.

235
00:16:12,351 --> 00:16:15,549
There's no taking this back.

236
00:16:22,485 --> 00:16:24,667
It's not over, Mikasa.

237
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:28,066
That's impossible!

238
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,001
I blew up the nape of its neck.

239
00:16:30,084 --> 00:16:32,667
And I crushed its nape
with all my strength.

240
00:16:32,751 --> 00:16:35,015
Yet, it's still alive.

241
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:42,615
Huh.

242
00:16:45,018 --> 00:16:47,200
I think I get it now.

243
00:16:47,284 --> 00:16:49,267
The War Hammer Titan uses hardening

244
00:16:49,351 --> 00:16:51,534
to make whatever it needs.

245
00:16:51,618 --> 00:16:52,601
And it won't die,

246
00:16:52,685 --> 00:16:56,267
no matter how much damage
we deal to its neck.

247
00:16:56,351 --> 00:16:59,134
Mikasa. Keep it
occupied for me.

248
00:16:59,218 --> 00:17:01,748
If this works, I'll be
able to eat the War Hammer.

249
00:17:04,551 --> 00:17:07,067
I'm truly sorry,
but we're overwhelmed as it is.

250
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,134
And that child is already deceased.

251
00:17:09,218 --> 00:17:11,267
No. Wait. You haven't
even looked at him yet!

252
00:17:11,351 --> 00:17:13,067
If you're actually a Warrior candidate,

253
00:17:13,151 --> 00:17:14,534
then wake up and look at reality.

254
00:17:14,618 --> 00:17:16,067
Doctor! We need you!

255
00:17:16,151 --> 00:17:17,982
Right! On my way!

256
00:17:21,685 --> 00:17:25,601
Gabi. You should
go find your family.

257
00:17:25,685 --> 00:17:28,667
I'm not sure if anywhere's safe, but

258
00:17:28,751 --> 00:17:31,735
get as far from the plaza as you can.

259
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:33,667
I just need to track down Falco...

260
00:17:33,751 --> 00:17:35,482
I'm going, too.

261
00:17:36,218 --> 00:17:42,334
Because I don't get why
Udo and Zofia... needed to die.

262
00:17:42,418 --> 00:17:44,515
Wait. It's not safe, Gabi!

263
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:51,801
Hey, stop!

264
00:17:51,885 --> 00:17:53,601
You're heading straight
into a war zone, kid!

265
00:17:53,685 --> 00:17:54,801
Gabi!

266
00:17:54,885 --> 00:17:56,467
What are you doing here?

267
00:17:56,551 --> 00:18:01,067
Oh, it's you two. I'm ready
to fight, so let me pass!

268
00:18:01,151 --> 00:18:02,601
Stop acting like a stupid brat.

269
00:18:02,685 --> 00:18:05,148
Find your family and lay low.

270
00:18:06,084 --> 00:18:06,934
What the...?

271
00:18:07,018 --> 00:18:07,801
We're under attack!

272
00:18:07,885 --> 00:18:08,717
Where from?

273
00:18:11,885 --> 00:18:12,601
Above us!

274
00:18:12,685 --> 00:18:15,801
Oh shit. Start
running and don't...

275
00:18:15,885 --> 00:18:18,415
Son of a...

276
00:18:22,218 --> 00:18:24,182
Oh my god.

277
00:18:36,751 --> 00:18:39,667
This street's blocked off.
Let's go, Sasha.

278
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:40,801
Slow down.

279
00:18:40,885 --> 00:18:43,601
You forgot that we need to
set a lamp out, Conny.

280
00:18:43,685 --> 00:18:45,148
Oh. Right.

281
00:19:07,685 --> 00:19:09,467
We've stalled their reinforcements.

282
00:19:09,551 --> 00:19:11,067
What about the lights?

283
00:19:11,151 --> 00:19:13,067
All of them are in place now.

284
00:19:13,151 --> 00:19:14,667
Are things going all right?

285
00:19:14,751 --> 00:19:16,482
They are for now at least.

286
00:19:22,685 --> 00:19:26,067
If we can take that
thing out soon, we'll be fine.

287
00:19:26,151 --> 00:19:27,601
But that's a big if.

288
00:19:27,685 --> 00:19:30,282
Looks like anything could
happen at this point.

289
00:19:34,819 --> 00:19:37,467
The only way to find out
what will come next

290
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:41,915
is to make it out of
this mess alive. So focus.

291
00:19:59,285 --> 00:20:01,601
I knew that something was off.

292
00:20:01,685 --> 00:20:03,334
There was something abnormal about

293
00:20:03,418 --> 00:20:06,449
the way the War Hammer materialized.

294
00:20:07,218 --> 00:20:09,667
It was the first time I'd seen a Titan

295
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:11,582
form from the feet up.

296
00:20:13,418 --> 00:20:15,467
Not from its neck,

297
00:20:15,551 --> 00:20:18,616
but from beneath the stage
it was standing on.

298
00:20:22,285 --> 00:20:25,182
So that's where its body is.

299
00:20:55,485 --> 00:20:59,382
Damn it. The War Hammer's
about to get eaten!

300
00:21:10,218 --> 00:21:13,067
This is the moment I've been waiting for!

301
00:21:13,151 --> 00:21:16,067
I'm taking the Founder right now!

302
00:21:16,151 --> 00:21:17,449
Eren!

303
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,982
Why... can't I bite?

304
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:27,467
Wait. Could that be him?

305
00:21:27,551 --> 00:21:29,616
Is that Ackermann?

306
00:21:35,285 --> 00:21:37,115
I need to fall back.

307
00:21:46,018 --> 00:21:49,267
What the hell?

308
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:51,449
Can't you see I'm a Titan?

309
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:56,800
Are a bunch of humans

310
00:21:56,884 --> 00:22:00,482
really about to come and kill me?

311
00:22:02,485 --> 00:22:05,401
No. They're not humans.

312
00:22:05,485 --> 00:22:06,649
They're devils!

313
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:43,006
The devils of Paradis.

314
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:45,607
Marley's Warriors have met their match

315
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:48,341
in these soldiers who
soar through the air.

316
00:23:48,425 --> 00:23:50,941
Gabi and Falco cry out to Reiner.

317
00:23:51,024 --> 00:23:52,807
Will he hear their pleas?

318
00:23:52,891 --> 00:23:54,988
Next episode: "Assault."
