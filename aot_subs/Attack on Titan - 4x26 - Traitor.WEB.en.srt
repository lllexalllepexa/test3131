1
00:00:19,106 --> 00:00:23,026
[HANGE] I never expected Floch
to take action this quickly.

2
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:26,696
[MAGATH] If the Jaegerists
destroy the flying boat,

3
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:29,066
our plan would be
dead in the water.

4
00:00:29,156 --> 00:00:31,986
So why haven't they
done it already?

5
00:00:32,076 --> 00:00:34,286
[HANGE]
Hard to say.

6
00:00:34,366 --> 00:00:36,576
If I had to guess,
they suspect we're alive,

7
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:38,496
and maybe that we're
trying to stop Eren,

8
00:00:38,576 --> 00:00:40,916
but they're not entirely sure.

9
00:00:40,996 --> 00:00:43,376
They could blow it up
in a second if they wanted to,

10
00:00:43,456 --> 00:00:44,876
but they can't
build another one.

11
00:00:44,966 --> 00:00:46,416
Without the
Azumabito's knowledge,

12
00:00:46,506 --> 00:00:48,926
they would have to
start from scratch.

13
00:00:49,006 --> 00:00:51,136
They'll wanna use it
for themselves if they can,

14
00:00:51,216 --> 00:00:53,926
to make sure the mainland's
been wiped clean.

15
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:56,346
Plus, there're Azumabito
ships here.

16
00:00:56,436 --> 00:00:58,056
That might be
their real objective:

17
00:00:58,136 --> 00:00:59,306
to capture a small fleet

18
00:00:59,396 --> 00:01:01,566
and the technicians
to keep it afloat.

19
00:01:01,646 --> 00:01:03,066
But regardless.

20
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:05,396
The Jaegerists would readily
sacrifice that objective

21
00:01:05,486 --> 00:01:07,316
if they caught wind of us.

22
00:01:07,396 --> 00:01:11,406
They'll blow the flying boat to
bits the second we're spotted.

23
00:01:11,486 --> 00:01:13,236
We've got a few of the Nine,

24
00:01:13,326 --> 00:01:14,746
so our odds are
better than they'd be

25
00:01:14,826 --> 00:01:18,326
in a straight firefight.
But not good.

26
00:01:19,286 --> 00:01:21,876
[MAGATH] True. We'll just
have to make the best of it.

27
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,706
Fighting the Founder'll
be even worse.

28
00:01:23,796 --> 00:01:24,546
[Gasps]

29
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,586
We'd better plan to--

♪ Opening Song ♪

31
00:03:16,156 --> 00:03:17,946
[ANNIE] We have no choice
but to kill 'em all

32
00:03:18,026 --> 00:03:19,616
with our first strike.

33
00:03:19,696 --> 00:03:23,156
That's the only way we can
secure the flying boat.

34
00:03:23,246 --> 00:03:26,286
To pull this off,
everyone's gotta be in sync.

35
00:03:26,376 --> 00:03:31,296
We need our Titan power and
your firepower. Understood?

36
00:03:33,626 --> 00:03:35,046
Just hold on a second.

37
00:03:35,126 --> 00:03:36,716
What's the problem?

38
00:03:37,966 --> 00:03:40,636
The Jaegerists are holding
all the Azumabito hostage.

39
00:03:40,716 --> 00:03:42,306
We need to keep them
out of the line of fire.

40
00:03:42,386 --> 00:03:44,436
[CONNY gasps]
Yeah, exactly!

41
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,596
You expect us to
care about that?

42
00:03:46,686 --> 00:03:48,606
We won't protect people
who've attacked our homeland

43
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:50,476
just 'cause they're
your distant cousins.

44
00:03:50,566 --> 00:03:53,486
[PIECK] Slow down, Annie.
If the hostages are killed,

45
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:56,656
the rest of the plan
falls apart.

46
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,566
Right, Onyankopon?

47
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:00,536
Yeah, we need him alive.

48
00:04:00,616 --> 00:04:02,326
I should be able to
pilot their boat,

49
00:04:02,406 --> 00:04:04,826
but first we gotta
get it into flying shape.

50
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:06,116
That's the problem.

51
00:04:06,206 --> 00:04:08,166
We need the mechanics
to set up the wings.

52
00:04:08,246 --> 00:04:11,916
Otherwise, none of us are
gonna be flying anywhere.

53
00:04:11,996 --> 00:04:14,756
The wings are folded up
to make it easier to tow,

54
00:04:14,836 --> 00:04:17,086
so they'll need to be
extended and secured.

55
00:04:17,176 --> 00:04:19,136
And even then,
there's still more to do

56
00:04:19,216 --> 00:04:21,216
before we can get airborne.

57
00:04:22,386 --> 00:04:23,926
[ONYANKOPON] The original
plan was to hangar it

58
00:04:24,016 --> 00:04:25,226
'til we had some pilots trained,

59
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:27,136
so we're skipping
a lot of steps,

60
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:28,306
but they'll at least
need some time

61
00:04:28,396 --> 00:04:30,856
to service it before takeoff.

62
00:04:30,936 --> 00:04:34,396
Start to finish, how long
is it gonna take to service?

63
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:39,616
I couldn't say.
It'll be up to the mechanics.

64
00:04:43,446 --> 00:04:45,956
I get it. But to confirm,

65
00:04:46,036 --> 00:04:48,706
you're asking us to protect
the Azumabito technicians

66
00:04:48,786 --> 00:04:52,456
from the Jaegerists long enough
to get the boat ready to fly.

67
00:04:52,546 --> 00:04:53,666
And let me guess.

68
00:04:53,746 --> 00:04:55,206
You want us to
hold the enemy off

69
00:04:55,296 --> 00:04:59,216
for this unknown length of time
without killing any of them.

70
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:03,846
If at all possible.

71
00:05:03,926 --> 00:05:06,386
We've known these guys
ever since we were cadets.

72
00:05:06,476 --> 00:05:09,896
Then I'm sure you've got a plan.
Think you could fill me in?

73
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,186
We don't even have
an estimate on

74
00:05:11,266 --> 00:05:13,646
how long the Azumabito
will need yet.

75
00:05:13,726 --> 00:05:15,356
So you must have some scheme to

76
00:05:15,436 --> 00:05:17,856
keep the Jaegerists
occupied indefinitely

77
00:05:17,946 --> 00:05:19,276
without killing them.

78
00:05:19,356 --> 00:05:22,276
Can you explain it in detail?

79
00:05:22,366 --> 00:05:25,156
There is a plan, right, Armin?

80
00:05:25,246 --> 00:05:27,156
You had one for me.

81
00:05:30,746 --> 00:05:33,046
There's no way
to make that happen.

82
00:05:33,126 --> 00:05:35,586
We have to wipe them out
with a lightning strike,

83
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:38,836
or else a survivor will destroy
the boat and strand us here.

84
00:05:40,836 --> 00:05:43,176
[CONNY] Hold on! We can see
that it's a long shot,

85
00:05:43,256 --> 00:05:45,096
but we're doing this
to help people!

86
00:05:45,176 --> 00:05:47,096
So what? You're saying
we have to gun down

to save the world?

88
00:05:49,886 --> 00:05:51,556
That's so messed up!

89
00:05:56,186 --> 00:05:59,896
[ANNIE] I'm sorry. This'll be
a pretty ugly operation.

00:05:59,986 --> 00:06:03,486
We shouldn't expect
you guys to take part in it.

91
00:06:03,566 --> 00:06:06,826
We don't even have the right
to drop that choice on you.

If it had been you in our place,

93
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,126
you probably would have
chosen differently

94
00:06:12,206 --> 00:06:13,666
than we did that day.

95
00:06:13,746 --> 00:06:15,416

breached the wall.

I am the same as you.

[REINER] None of you
need to join this battle.

Stick with Gabi and Falco.

00:06:33,016 --> 00:06:35,646
Stay at a safe distance
and observe.

103
00:06:35,726 --> 00:06:37,066
You'll have to defend yourselves

104
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:40,486
if the Jaegerists spot you,
so be prepared to fight.

105
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,816
But for now,
just stay out of it.

106
00:06:46,786 --> 00:06:50,446
And let you guys kill each other
while we sit back and watch?

107
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:51,746
Would that work?

108
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:52,996
Can Titans even win this

109
00:06:53,076 --> 00:06:55,576
without infantry
backing them up?

[HANGE] I've got no intention
of being a spectator.

Look. I know they
were our comrades,

113
00:07:03,336 --> 00:07:05,586
but I've already
had to shoot four.

114
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:08,426
On top of that, our window
for saving humanity

115
00:07:08,506 --> 00:07:10,766
is shorter than we realized.

116
00:07:10,846 --> 00:07:13,056
I saw the Titans
crossing the sea,

117
00:07:13,136 --> 00:07:16,146
leaving monstrous clouds
of steam in their wake,

118
00:07:16,226 --> 00:07:18,396
and considering how fast
they were moving,

119
00:07:18,476 --> 00:07:22,396
they've probably made
landfall in Marley by now.

The closest cities in
Northeastern Marley

I wanted to believe

was justified as part of
some great cause.

00:10:24,996 --> 00:10:26,956
[ARMIN]
I'm not doing that.

175
00:10:29,256 --> 00:10:32,886
I refuse to let someone else
stain their hands in my place.

176
00:10:46,106 --> 00:10:49,686
[FLOCH] Look at the size
of those steam clouds.

177
00:10:49,776 --> 00:10:53,026
History has never changed
so much in a single day!

178
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:57,906
[FLOCH] Of course, the history
of Hizuru will change as well.

179
00:10:57,986 --> 00:11:01,036
All of civilization is
about to be flattened,

180
00:11:01,116 --> 00:11:04,496
and something new
will arise where it stood.

181
00:11:04,576 --> 00:11:07,796
Whatever concerns you had
will soon be dead and gone.

182
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:10,206
We have only the future
to worry about,

183
00:11:10,296 --> 00:11:13,256
so focus on what you can
contribute to the island.

184
00:11:13,336 --> 00:11:15,506
These gentlemen, for instance.

185
00:11:15,586 --> 00:11:17,056
Hizuru's brightest
engineers will be

186
00:11:17,136 --> 00:11:22,016
a valuable asset to
our homeland. Right?

187
00:11:22,096 --> 00:11:24,846
It would be a shame to
have to lose any more of them,

188
00:11:24,936 --> 00:11:27,396
so please kindly
do as you're told.

189
00:11:29,476 --> 00:11:31,356
I was hoping I could
avoid saying anything

190
00:11:31,436 --> 00:11:33,276
that would disrupt
this fine mood you're in.

191
00:11:33,356 --> 00:11:34,356
Huh?

192
00:11:34,446 --> 00:11:35,986
But what is this change
you speak of,

193
00:11:36,066 --> 00:11:38,446
and what good do you
think would come of it?

194
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,246
If you believe slaughtering
the human race

195
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,616
will guarantee peace
here on Paradis,

196
00:11:43,706 --> 00:11:45,786
you'll be quite disappointed.

197
00:11:47,246 --> 00:11:48,996
You won't make your world
any less violent

198
00:11:49,086 --> 00:11:50,956
by making it smaller.

199
00:11:51,046 --> 00:11:52,756
When tomorrow comes,
you'll have accomplished

200
00:11:52,836 --> 00:11:56,136
nothing more than containing
the killing to your own home.

201
00:11:59,766 --> 00:12:01,926
I'll take your words to heart.

202
00:12:02,016 --> 00:12:05,516
In fact, I've been approaching
the same conclusion.

203
00:12:05,596 --> 00:12:09,856
But in any world, it's important
to understand our place.

204
00:12:12,396 --> 00:12:15,156
Hizuru's technology
would be useful to Eldia,

205
00:12:15,236 --> 00:12:17,446
but our security's
our greatest concern,

206
00:12:17,526 --> 00:12:18,776
and we don't need a flying boat

207
00:12:18,866 --> 00:12:21,986
or a seafaring fleet to
move forward as a nation.

208
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:25,166
Trouble will be
nipped in the bud. Got it?

209
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:27,456
This is the world now.

210
00:12:27,536 --> 00:12:32,956
You need to recognize your place
in it. Do you understand?

211
00:12:33,046 --> 00:12:36,216
[ARMIN]
Floch! Where are you?

212
00:12:36,296 --> 00:12:38,586
We need the Azumabito!

213
00:12:38,676 --> 00:12:39,966
Wait, Armin?

214
00:12:40,056 --> 00:12:41,176
[ARMIN]
There you are!

215
00:12:41,256 --> 00:12:42,596
[FLOCH]
What are you yelling for?

216
00:12:42,676 --> 00:12:44,266
Where have you been?

217
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,396
[ARMIN]
I was following the Cart Titan!

218
00:12:46,476 --> 00:12:48,346
It regrouped with
the Armored Titan.

219
00:12:48,436 --> 00:12:50,226
They're escaping
together by sea!

220
00:12:50,316 --> 00:12:52,146
We can't let them
catch up with Eren!

221
00:12:52,226 --> 00:12:54,186
We need that
flying boat airborne!

222
00:12:54,276 --> 00:12:57,566
Tell the Azumabito mechanics
to get it ready, right now!

223
00:13:01,326 --> 00:13:02,736
What are you telling me, Armin?

224
00:13:02,826 --> 00:13:04,616
Why didn't you
chase after the Cart?

225
00:13:04,696 --> 00:13:06,746
If you had,
this would be over by now!

226
00:13:06,826 --> 00:13:09,166
It was obvious that
they were gonna head south!

227
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:10,576
Now we've lost them.

228
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:13,086
You know they killed Jean
and Onyonkopon, right?

229
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:16,376
[CONNY] Armin!
The flying boat's over here!

230
00:13:17,716 --> 00:13:20,086
[ARMIN] Floch! Get the
Azumabito mechanics

231
00:13:20,176 --> 00:13:22,136
down here right away!

232
00:13:33,776 --> 00:13:36,106
--Hold on!
--Stop right there!

233
00:13:36,186 --> 00:13:38,986
[CONNY] Daz? Samuel?
What are you doing?

234
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:44,116
[CONNY gasps]
Are those explosives?

235
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:47,116
[ARMIN]
Get 'em off the boat already!

236
00:13:47,196 --> 00:13:49,116
[CONNY] Hurry up, we gotta
get this thing ready to launch!

237
00:13:49,206 --> 00:13:50,746
The Marleyans are
gonna get away!

238
00:13:50,826 --> 00:13:52,996
--[DAZ] Easy!
--[SAMUEL] Settle down, okay?

239
00:13:53,086 --> 00:13:54,756
We need to talk first.

240
00:13:54,836 --> 00:13:57,376
There have been rumors
going around since yesterday.

241
00:13:57,466 --> 00:13:59,126
People say you guys
teamed up with Marley,

242
00:13:59,216 --> 00:14:00,546
and that you plan to
use the flying boat

243
00:14:00,636 --> 00:14:02,426
to stop the rumbling.

244
00:14:02,506 --> 00:14:03,846
That's not true, is it?

245
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,806
[ARMIN gasps]

246
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,806
What? What kinda
crazy talk is that?

247
00:14:08,886 --> 00:14:10,266
We're with you!

248
00:14:10,346 --> 00:14:12,806
Eren has to finish the job,
or this island is doomed!

249
00:14:12,896 --> 00:14:15,316
Yeah. That's what I thought.

250
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:18,026
We've been fighting so long
to save our home.

251
00:14:18,106 --> 00:14:19,446
After all you've been through,

252
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:22,446
I knew there was no way you'd
put us in danger again.

253
00:14:23,526 --> 00:14:24,946
Yeah, you're damn right,
there's not!

254
00:14:25,036 --> 00:14:26,786
That's a relief.

255
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,536
If you'd actually
turned your backs on us,

256
00:14:28,616 --> 00:14:30,956
I can't even imagine
what I would have done.

257
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:34,916
[ARMIN] But we didn't, Daz.
Now, the explosives, please?

258
00:14:43,506 --> 00:14:44,966
[DAZ]
I know you get that Eren's doing

259
00:14:45,056 --> 00:14:47,266
what's necessary to protect us.

260
00:14:47,346 --> 00:14:48,636
But a part of me still
thought you might

261
00:14:48,716 --> 00:14:51,846
side with the enemy
and try to stop him.

262
00:15:02,856 --> 00:15:06,406
[Gasps] What's wrong, guys?

263
00:15:06,486 --> 00:15:08,736
I disconnected the detonator.

264
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:11,706
[ARMIN]
That's done.

265
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,326
Now we have to hope
Floch listens to me

266
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,996
and sends out the
Azumabito mechanics.

267
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,376
[ARMIN]
If we can get the boat ready,

268
00:15:18,456 --> 00:15:22,506
all we'll need is a way to get
our team aboard, and it's over.

269
00:15:22,586 --> 00:15:24,716
There's a chance
we can pull this off

270
00:15:24,796 --> 00:15:27,756
and stop Eren without
any more killing.

271
00:15:34,686 --> 00:15:36,476
[FLOCH]
Think about it.

272
00:15:36,566 --> 00:15:39,226
It doesn't quite
add up, does it?

273
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:42,236
Armin said it was obvious that

274
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,526
the enemy would
flee to the south,

275
00:15:44,606 --> 00:15:47,526
but the locomotive is
the fastest way here.

276
00:15:48,786 --> 00:15:51,076
[FLOCH] Instead,
they pursued on horseback,

277
00:15:51,156 --> 00:15:53,576
even though the Cart
already had a head start.

278
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,956
[sighs] What have
they been up to

279
00:15:56,036 --> 00:15:58,496
since they went incommunicado?

280
00:15:58,586 --> 00:16:02,006
Truth is, there's no
proof of anything.

281
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:05,926
Still, my gut tells me
this is trouble.

282
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,096
So it's time to nip some buds.

283
00:16:08,176 --> 00:16:09,596
[ALL gasp]

284
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,436
[Gunshots]

285
00:16:21,936 --> 00:16:23,606
[ARMIN]
We failed!

286
00:16:25,696 --> 00:16:27,406
--[JAEGERIST 85A] Hey!
--[JAEGERIST 85B] Floch!

287
00:16:28,776 --> 00:16:32,446
Idiots! Quit staring
and blow her away!

288
00:16:32,536 --> 00:16:35,076
Did you think I'd
go down without a fight?

289
00:16:38,036 --> 00:16:39,706
[MIKASA grunts]

290
00:16:40,546 --> 00:16:42,506
Kiyomi, run!

291
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:45,006
[Yells]

292
00:16:47,386 --> 00:16:48,506
We're under attack!

293
00:16:48,586 --> 00:16:50,636
Mikasa, Armin, and Conny
have switched sides!

294
00:16:50,716 --> 00:16:55,556
They've betrayed
Eldia! Kill them!

295
00:16:57,686 --> 00:17:01,646
[MIKASA gasps] They're gonna
fire through the windows!

296
00:17:04,646 --> 00:17:06,486
Get down to the basement!

297
00:17:08,356 --> 00:17:09,776
[Gasps]

298
00:17:13,326 --> 00:17:15,406
[MIKASA]
It's a firefight now.

299
00:17:15,496 --> 00:17:16,996
The only way through

300
00:17:17,076 --> 00:17:19,326
is to wipe out
every last Jaegerist!

301
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,206
[KIYOMI]
Lady Mikasa!

302
00:17:23,756 --> 00:17:25,336
[MIKASA yells]

303
00:17:27,676 --> 00:17:29,586
[MAGATH]
This way, all of you!

304
00:17:29,676 --> 00:17:31,756
We can hunker down
in the basement!

305
00:17:31,846 --> 00:17:34,386
If you wanna stay alive,
then come with me!

306
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:47,276
Hold on!

307
00:17:47,356 --> 00:17:49,316
Wait, Daz! What are
you trying to--

308
00:17:52,866 --> 00:17:55,156
--Armin!
--[SAMUEL] Don't move!

309
00:17:58,656 --> 00:18:00,036
[CONNY]
Samuel.

310
00:18:03,626 --> 00:18:04,796
Don't stop.

311
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:07,836
Reconnect the detonator
and blow up the boat.

312
00:18:07,916 --> 00:18:09,506
Hurry up, Daz!

313
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,596
[CONNY]
Samuel? Hey.

314
00:18:15,676 --> 00:18:18,306
[SAMUEL] You said we'd
eat meat together, Conny.

315
00:18:18,386 --> 00:18:21,096
And we finally could've
made that happen.

316
00:18:21,186 --> 00:18:24,186
We've got room
to raise livestock,

317
00:18:24,266 --> 00:18:26,436
just like we imagined it!

318
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:33,196
[SAMUEL] Dammit all to hell.
How did it end up like this?

319
00:18:41,786 --> 00:18:44,336
The only way out of here
is through the enemy!

320
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,336
We'll be overrun
as soon as they regroup!

321
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,086
We'll be fine!
As long as we're down here,

322
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:50,626
we'll be safe when
our reinforcements

323
00:18:50,716 --> 00:18:53,466
jump into the fray
up on the surface!

324
00:18:53,546 --> 00:18:54,966
Enemy in the basement!

325
00:18:55,056 --> 00:18:57,386
Follow me and
bring more explosives!

326
00:19:06,776 --> 00:19:09,526
[FLOCH] Why would they
back themselves into a corner?

327
00:19:18,076 --> 00:19:21,326
[FLOCH]
No. They didn't!

328
00:19:29,966 --> 00:19:30,716
[Gasps]

329
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:31,916
[CONNY yells]

330
00:19:33,876 --> 00:19:39,466
[ONYANKOPON] The plan failed.
Why does it always end this way?

331
00:19:40,726 --> 00:19:44,976
Violence will always be
a part of human existence,

332
00:19:45,056 --> 00:19:47,646
won't it, Captain?

333
00:20:02,456 --> 00:20:04,166
[JAEGERISTS gasp]

334
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:07,376
[JAEGERISTS scream]

335
00:20:21,766 --> 00:20:24,136
[JAEGERIST 85O] We need to
get more Thunder Spears!

336
00:20:25,306 --> 00:20:26,806
No, no, no!

337
00:20:41,906 --> 00:20:43,496
You have to blow up
the boat, Daz!

338
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:44,746
[Gasps]

339
00:20:53,506 --> 00:20:55,166
Stop, Armin!

340
00:20:56,796 --> 00:20:58,586
Get off me!

341
00:21:03,306 --> 00:21:06,266
[DAZ]
I don't wanna do this!

342
00:21:06,346 --> 00:21:07,226
Armin!

343
00:21:07,306 --> 00:21:08,976
Why are you betraying us?

00:21:09,056 --> 00:21:11,016
I don't understand, Conny!

345
00:21:11,106 --> 00:21:14,526

We still are on
the same side, Samuel!

Hesitation is death.
