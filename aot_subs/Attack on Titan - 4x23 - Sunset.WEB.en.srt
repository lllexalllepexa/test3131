"Promise me you'll return."

In that moment,

really were family.

00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:43,226
who are just as important
to them, as he is to me.

171
00:10:43,306 --> 00:10:46,396
I can't just tell myself
nothing matters anymore.

172
00:10:46,476 --> 00:10:48,026
It all matters.

173
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:49,146
And after what I've done,

174
00:10:49,236 --> 00:10:51,986
I don't think I can
ever be redeemed.

175
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,446
[ANNIE]
But...

176
00:10:58,536 --> 00:11:02,956
If it would get me back to
my dad, I'd do it all again.

177
00:11:08,546 --> 00:11:12,676
Thank you. I'm glad you
shared that with me.

178
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:14,506
But I'm sorry.

179
00:11:14,586 --> 00:11:16,596
I don't think you'll have
anything to go back to now

180
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,846
but a corpse in the rubble.

181
00:11:20,726 --> 00:11:21,976
[ANNIE]
I know.

182
00:11:27,856 --> 00:11:30,316
[ANNIE'S FATHER] Sir, please,
I couldn't make this up!

183
00:11:30,396 --> 00:11:32,316
You had that
daydream too, right?

184
00:11:32,396 --> 00:11:34,406
This was inevitable.

185
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,316
Those island devils
were always going to be

186
00:11:36,406 --> 00:11:37,826
the death of us in the end.

187
00:11:37,906 --> 00:11:39,946
Please be okay, Gabi.

188
00:11:40,036 --> 00:11:42,456
[COLT'S MOTHER]
Oh, Falco.

189
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:45,116
As we speak, the rumbling
has already begun!

190
00:11:45,206 --> 00:11:47,456
Eren Jaeger is on his way
with an army of Titans

191
00:11:47,536 --> 00:11:48,796
to kill everyone here!

192
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:50,876
Your home and family
and everything you care for

193
00:11:50,956 --> 00:11:52,586
is about to be stomped flat!

194
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,716
[Gasps] You really
expect me to believe

195
00:11:54,796 --> 00:11:57,256
a word out of your
hell-spawn mouths?

196
00:11:57,346 --> 00:11:59,766
You all had the
same dream, and what,

197
00:11:59,846 --> 00:12:01,636
you think we'll just
let you through the gate?

198
00:12:01,716 --> 00:12:03,476
You're putting on
a show, aren't you?

199
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:05,726
How long have you swine
been planning this?

200
00:12:05,806 --> 00:12:07,356
If you call up
any internment zone

201
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:08,566
in the whole world right now,

202
00:12:08,646 --> 00:12:10,316
every Eldian will be
saying the same thing!

203
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,646
Do you honestly think we all

204
00:12:11,726 --> 00:12:12,986
could've coordinated
that somehow?

205
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:15,356
And how do I know
that you didn't?

206
00:12:15,446 --> 00:12:17,066
As a matter of fact,
this is beginning to

207
00:12:17,156 --> 00:12:19,446
feel like an admission
of conspiracy!

208
00:12:19,526 --> 00:12:21,486
Round 'em all up!

209
00:12:21,576 --> 00:12:22,996
[MARLEYAN SOLDIER 82B]
Get on your knees!

210
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,746
[MARLEYAN SOLDIER 82C]
Hands behind your heads!

211
00:12:24,826 --> 00:12:27,166
He said,
"Hands behind your head!"

212
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:33,336
[ANNIE'S FATHER]
Promise me you'll return.

213
00:12:35,506 --> 00:12:37,386
[ANNIE'S FATHER]
That's all I ask.

214
00:12:39,846 --> 00:12:43,596
[ANNIE]
Okay. I promise, Dad.

215
00:12:44,516 --> 00:12:48,226
[Yells]

216
00:12:53,436 --> 00:12:54,936
Gunfire?

217
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,566
[SURMA]
I've got bad news.

218
00:12:57,656 --> 00:12:59,486
The Jaegerists are
taking over the fort.

219
00:12:59,566 --> 00:13:02,486
If they catch you,
who knows what they'll do?

220
00:13:02,576 --> 00:13:05,996
You should run for it before
they find out you're here, sir.

221
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,616
It's fine.

222
00:13:07,706 --> 00:13:10,706
There isn't any place
for me to go at this point.

223
00:13:10,786 --> 00:13:13,126
The core of our
military is gone,

224
00:13:13,206 --> 00:13:15,456
literally sliced at the nape.

225
00:13:17,836 --> 00:13:20,386
The Jaegerists are
gaining popular support.

226
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,966
They're securing
the island as we speak.

227
00:13:23,056 --> 00:13:25,136
That means finishing off
the old regime.

228
00:13:25,216 --> 00:13:27,136
They're gonna want me dead.

229
00:13:27,226 --> 00:13:29,146
And I'm too old for exile.

230
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:30,476
I don't wanna
have to shit outdoors

231
00:13:30,556 --> 00:13:32,226
on some lonely mountain.

232
00:13:32,316 --> 00:13:34,316
We'd've been eaten alive
if not for you, sir.

233
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:35,526
We won't leave you now!

234
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:36,816
That's right,
no matter what happens next,

235
00:13:36,896 --> 00:13:38,776
we'll fight to keep you safe!

236
00:13:38,856 --> 00:13:40,486
[KEITH]
You damn fools.

237
00:13:40,566 --> 00:13:41,986
[BOTH gasp]

238
00:13:42,066 --> 00:13:43,986
[KEITH] Why do you think I
rolled over and let a bunch of

239
00:13:44,076 --> 00:13:48,116
wimpy tots like you pretend you
had the grit to kick my ass?

240
00:13:48,206 --> 00:13:49,826
[BOTH gasp]

241
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,246
[KEITH]
Keep your heads down.

242
00:13:51,326 --> 00:13:54,246
Do exactly as
the Jaegerists say.

243
00:13:54,336 --> 00:13:56,666
All that you punks can
protect is yourselves.

244
00:13:56,756 --> 00:13:58,676
So focus on that.

245
00:13:58,756 --> 00:14:01,006
Go out and toe
the Jaegerist line.

246
00:14:01,086 --> 00:14:03,346
That's the only way?

247
00:14:03,426 --> 00:14:04,886
[KEITH]
It is.

248
00:14:04,966 --> 00:14:08,476
Live long enough and you'll
get your chance to rebel.

249
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:12,356
In the meantime, do your best
not to lose yourselves.

250
00:14:14,106 --> 00:14:16,106
[MIKASA]
Armin. Wait.

251
00:14:16,186 --> 00:14:17,986
Connie has too much
of a lead now.

252
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:20,276
You won't reach Ragako in time.

253
00:14:21,606 --> 00:14:23,276
And besides.

254
00:14:23,366 --> 00:14:25,786
There's nothing you could say
if you did catch him.

255
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:28,656
You really plan to ask him
to give up on saving his mother?

256
00:14:28,746 --> 00:14:31,166
You think that's right?

257
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:33,666
Yeah, I do.

258
00:14:33,746 --> 00:14:35,706
And even if I am bound to fail,

259
00:14:35,796 --> 00:14:39,336
I still have to do everything
I possibly can to save Falco.

260
00:14:39,416 --> 00:14:42,756
Because if I don't, then Gabi
will never come to trust us.

261
00:14:42,836 --> 00:14:44,596
It's crucial that
we win her over.

262
00:14:44,676 --> 00:14:46,966
Reiner and the Cart Titan are
still out there somewhere

263
00:14:47,056 --> 00:14:48,676
and I believe she's
the best hope we have

264
00:14:48,766 --> 00:14:51,686
of creating some kind
of truce with them.

265
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,976
It's not as if the issue
of Titan inheritance

266
00:14:54,056 --> 00:14:56,316
is going away anytime soon.

267
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,316
If worse comes to worse,
we could end up

268
00:14:58,396 --> 00:15:00,696
in another struggle
for control of the Nine.

269
00:15:00,776 --> 00:15:03,356
Repeating the wars of
the last two thousand years,

270
00:15:03,446 --> 00:15:05,866
but on this tiny
little island of ours.

271
00:15:06,866 --> 00:15:08,406
[ARMIN]
Honestly, I'm so exhausted,

272
00:15:08,486 --> 00:15:11,916
all I wanna do is sleep
for the next couple days.

273
00:15:11,996 --> 00:15:15,496
But human history is passing
through a bottleneck right now,

274
00:15:15,576 --> 00:15:17,246
so the actions we choose to take

275
00:15:17,336 --> 00:15:19,706
could have a huge
impact on the future.

276
00:15:19,796 --> 00:15:21,586
He can't go through with this.

277
00:15:21,676 --> 00:15:23,216
So yeah, I'll tell
Conny that his mom

278
00:15:23,296 --> 00:15:25,636
might need to stay
a Titan forever.

279
00:15:28,926 --> 00:15:30,346
See you later.

280
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:38,226
[MIKASA] Armin.
Any idea what I should do?

281
00:15:38,316 --> 00:15:40,566
Seems likely that
Jean could use your help.

282
00:15:40,646 --> 00:15:42,776
You'll have to figure out
the rest for yourself.

283
00:15:42,856 --> 00:15:46,156
[MIKASA]
So what'll we do about Eren?

284
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,866
[ARMIN]
How the hell should I know?

285
00:15:47,946 --> 00:15:50,656
Who says there's
anything we can do?

286
00:15:50,746 --> 00:15:52,076
Not only are Hange
and the Captain

287
00:15:52,156 --> 00:15:53,666
probably dead right now,

288
00:15:53,746 --> 00:15:55,246
but if we get on
Floch's bad side,

289
00:15:55,326 --> 00:15:56,496
we might get to join them.

290
00:15:56,576 --> 00:15:57,666
Let's see what else.

291
00:15:57,746 --> 00:16:00,166
Oh right, Annie's
probably back in action.

292
00:16:00,256 --> 00:16:01,376
And what's left
of the military's

293
00:16:01,456 --> 00:16:03,006
chain of command
has been shattered.

294
00:16:03,086 --> 00:16:04,296
It's in chaos!

295
00:16:04,376 --> 00:16:07,756
Also. Historia's probably
in danger right now.

296
00:16:07,846 --> 00:16:10,306
Along with the
Azumabito clan, Nicolo,

297
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:11,926
and the Volunteers from Marley.

298
00:16:12,016 --> 00:16:13,056
It's too much!

299
00:16:13,136 --> 00:16:14,516
There's no point
in worrying about Eren,

300
00:16:14,596 --> 00:16:16,646
we can't stop him,
he's a lost cause!

301
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:19,316
Why can't you understand that?

302
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:20,726
[Gasps]

303
00:16:24,396 --> 00:16:25,816
[MIKASA]
Sorry.

304
00:16:33,116 --> 00:16:35,866
[ARMIN] If you were talking to
Commander Erwin right now,

305
00:16:35,956 --> 00:16:39,086
there's no way he would've
snapped at you like that.

306
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,836
I guess we know for a fact now.

307
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:46,176
Captain Levi saved
the wrong person.

308
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:47,966
He should've chosen Erwin.

309
00:16:57,436 --> 00:17:00,516
[MIKASA]
My scarf, it's gone.

310
00:17:02,066 --> 00:17:03,646
[ARTUR]
Conny's a decent sort.

311
00:17:03,736 --> 00:17:05,396
Even if it's for
his mother's sake.

312
00:17:05,486 --> 00:17:08,316
He won't be able to sacrifice
a kid's life just like that.

313
00:17:08,406 --> 00:17:09,986
I'm sure he'll hesitate.

314
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:11,906
You should make it in time.

315
00:17:13,286 --> 00:17:15,616
[GABI]
Thank you, Mr. Braus.

316
00:17:15,706 --> 00:17:17,116
Think I'm gonna stick with them.

317
00:17:17,206 --> 00:17:19,786
I'll do my best to
get them out of here.

318
00:17:19,876 --> 00:17:21,246
My advice is to get as deep into

319
00:17:21,336 --> 00:17:24,086
the countryside
as you can, then.

320
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,336
[KAYA]
Mia.

321
00:17:27,586 --> 00:17:29,216
Take care, okay?

322
00:17:30,586 --> 00:17:33,056
My name isn't actually
Mia, you know.

323
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:35,766
It's Gabi. Gabi Braun.

324
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:39,476
Huh? That sounds so weird.
Bet you wish your name was Mia.

325
00:17:39,556 --> 00:17:40,896
Huh?

326
00:17:47,026 --> 00:17:48,606
[GABI]
See you, Kaya.

327
00:17:49,656 --> 00:17:52,196
[KAYA]
Goodbye, Gabi.

328
00:17:58,956 --> 00:18:01,626
Put the gun down, Floch.
Don't kill him!

329
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:06,006
I wasn't planning to.
I'm just helping him wake up.

330
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,256
He didn't seem to comprehend
the situation he was in,

331
00:18:10,336 --> 00:18:12,756
but I think I've
gotten message across.

332
00:18:12,846 --> 00:18:14,676
Now these volunteers
know what'll happen

333
00:18:14,766 --> 00:18:18,016
if they're mouthy
or make trouble.

334
00:18:18,096 --> 00:18:21,266
Hey. Last I checked,
this island didn't have a king,

335
00:18:21,346 --> 00:18:23,516
so who the hell
nominated you to act like one?

336
00:18:23,606 --> 00:18:25,776
[FLOCH]
I'm so glad you asked, Jean.

337
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:27,736
All right, people, listen up!

338
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:29,776
Ten months back,
I talked to Eren.

339
00:18:29,856 --> 00:18:32,526
And he told me all about
his plan to protect Eldia.

340
00:18:32,616 --> 00:18:33,816
He laid out every detail,

341
00:18:33,906 --> 00:18:35,366
right up to the moment
we all witnessed,

342
00:18:35,446 --> 00:18:37,036
when he used Founder's power!

343
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,286
[Gasps]

344
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:40,116
He said to gather up comrades.

345
00:18:40,206 --> 00:18:41,786
I did, and with our help,

346
00:18:41,866 --> 00:18:44,836
he's been able to secure
our island's future!

347
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:47,086
You volunteers have
lost your leader,

348
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,416
and thanks to your wine,

349
00:18:48,506 --> 00:18:51,086
the old military isn't here
to back you, either.

350
00:18:51,176 --> 00:18:53,796
What's more, you're about
to lose your homelands!

351
00:18:53,886 --> 00:18:55,096
The whole world will soon be

352
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:58,016
flattened in great,
smoldering footprints.

353
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,476
Whatever chance
you thought you had

354
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:01,726
of liberating your peoples
and reviving your countries,

355
00:19:01,806 --> 00:19:03,726
you can give up on it now!

356
00:19:03,806 --> 00:19:05,646
You're beaten,
but if any of you would like

357
00:19:05,726 --> 00:19:07,646
to set the past aside
and serve Eldia

358
00:19:07,726 --> 00:19:10,236
for its own sake,
now's the time to speak.

359
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,566
Join us and we'll welcome you as

360
00:19:11,646 --> 00:19:14,316
full citizens of the
new Eldian Empire!

361
00:19:14,406 --> 00:19:16,236
Who the hell do you think
you are? I'll die before--

362
00:19:16,326 --> 00:19:17,786
[FLOCH]
Pay your respects!

363
00:19:22,956 --> 00:19:25,536
[FLOCH] This man kept
his pride to the end.

364
00:19:25,626 --> 00:19:28,086
He refused to submit
no matter what.

365
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:31,836
To him, dignity was
worth dying for.

366
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:35,636
But if you're asking my opinion,
you should just give in.

367
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:39,176
Is submitting really worse
than ending up like this?

368
00:19:41,846 --> 00:19:45,346
[FLOCH] Take some time to
think it over. Lock 'em up.

369
00:19:45,436 --> 00:19:46,766
[JAEGERIST 82A]
Yes, sir!

370
00:19:46,856 --> 00:19:49,226
Wait, what's going on here?

371
00:19:49,316 --> 00:19:52,106
Jean. What just happened?

372
00:19:54,236 --> 00:19:56,156
[FLOCH]
To answer your question,

373
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,696
I'm taking action
on Eren's behalf.

374
00:19:58,786 --> 00:20:00,326
He has his hands
full solving problems

375
00:20:00,406 --> 00:20:02,786
outside of the island right now,

376
00:20:02,866 --> 00:20:06,496
so I'm wiping out whatever
resentment is left within it.

377
00:20:06,576 --> 00:20:09,956
Four years ago, all of us
went through hell.

378
00:20:10,046 --> 00:20:12,006
But now, after suffering
through so much,

379
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,426
we've finally earned our reward.

380
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:16,796
Can you still
not see it yourself?

381
00:20:18,096 --> 00:20:19,886
You're finally free.

382
00:20:19,966 --> 00:20:22,226
You don't have any
obligation to fight anymore.

383
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:24,766
You can live as
you please now, Jean.

384
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,936
[FLOCH]
It's okay.

385
00:20:28,016 --> 00:20:31,566
You wanted to live the good life
in the interior as an MP right?

386
00:20:31,646 --> 00:20:35,446
Then go do it.
You're one of Eldia's heroes.

387
00:20:36,856 --> 00:20:39,906
I don't have to fight?

388
00:20:39,986 --> 00:20:41,496
No, you don't.

389
00:20:41,576 --> 00:20:44,406
You can simply go back
to being the old Jean.

390
00:20:44,496 --> 00:20:48,376
Be as annoying, selfish,
and arrogant as you please.

391
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,376
Well that's kinda rude.

392
00:20:52,256 --> 00:20:53,546
[Gasp]

393
00:20:53,626 --> 00:20:56,256
Tell me, Floch.
Do you know what happened to

394
00:20:56,336 --> 00:20:58,466
Captain Levi and
Commander Hange?

395
00:20:58,546 --> 00:21:03,636
[FLOCH] Ah. Unfortunately,
they were killed by Zeke.

396
00:21:05,386 --> 00:21:09,686
[FALCO] Conny. I appreciate
your helping me, but um,

397
00:21:09,766 --> 00:21:11,936
aren't we still going north?

398
00:21:12,026 --> 00:21:14,856
I mean look.
The sun's setting over there.

399
00:21:14,946 --> 00:21:16,356
That's for the best.

400
00:21:16,446 --> 00:21:19,196
We need to get as from the south
as we can, it's dangerous.

401
00:21:19,276 --> 00:21:21,116
With any luck,
the hospital I'm taking you to

402
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:23,406
will be able to
treat your amnesia.

403
00:21:23,496 --> 00:21:25,956
I found you all by yourself,
collapsed on the ground.

404
00:21:26,036 --> 00:21:27,576
It's true, all right?

405
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,246
I'm a soldier,
so it's only natural

406
00:21:29,326 --> 00:21:31,666
that I would do what I could.

407
00:21:31,746 --> 00:21:35,126
[CONNY] That's right.
I've become a soldier.

408
00:21:35,216 --> 00:21:38,006
[CONNY'S MOTHER] Become a
great soldier, okay, Connie?

409
00:21:38,086 --> 00:21:40,716
You'll be everyone's protector!

410
00:21:40,796 --> 00:21:43,846
[CONNY]
Dad, Sunny, and Martin are gone.

411
00:21:43,926 --> 00:21:45,766
They're never coming back.

412
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:48,016
But Mom still has a chance.

413
00:21:48,096 --> 00:21:50,516
Just wait a little
bit longer, Mom.

414
00:21:50,596 --> 00:21:53,186
I've become a soldier. And now--

415
00:21:53,276 --> 00:21:55,686
[FALCO]
Thanks so much, Conny.

416
00:21:55,776 --> 00:21:58,276
You've really gone
out of your way for me.

417
00:21:58,356 --> 00:21:59,816
I'm grateful.

418
00:22:00,906 --> 00:22:02,946
[CONNY]
It's nothing.

419
00:22:03,036 --> 00:22:06,156
[FALCO] I'm lucky I was
found by such a good person,

420
00:22:06,246 --> 00:22:09,286
but I need to get back
south somehow.

421
00:22:09,366 --> 00:22:12,626
I remember everything up to
when I met Colt and Gabi,

422
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:15,876
but everything
after that is a blur.

423
00:22:17,046 --> 00:22:19,836
[FALCO]
Also. This Conny guy.

424
00:22:19,926 --> 00:22:22,426
I feel like I've seen him
somewhere before.

425
00:22:22,506 --> 00:22:24,386
Still, if he doesn't know me,

426
00:22:24,466 --> 00:22:26,846
then maybe that's
just my imagination.

427
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:37,776
[PIECK] Judging from
their speed and heading,

428
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,276
it seems likely
that the airships

429
00:22:39,356 --> 00:22:41,776
are withdrawing to Marley.

430
00:22:41,856 --> 00:22:44,116
I guess once they saw
the rumbling start,

431
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,656
they panicked and decided
to save themselves,

432
00:22:46,746 --> 00:22:48,746
leaving the rest of us for dead.

433
00:22:48,826 --> 00:22:51,036
[MAGATH]
No. They did the right thing.

434
00:22:51,116 --> 00:22:52,286
Our forces in Marley need to

435
00:22:52,376 --> 00:22:55,166
be informed as
quickly as possible.

436
00:22:55,246 --> 00:22:56,916
If the ships had
waited for stragglers,

437
00:22:57,006 --> 00:22:59,166
they might've been crushed.

438
00:22:59,256 --> 00:23:02,426
Fair, but even with warning,

439
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,426
what'll our forces
be able to do?

440
00:23:04,506 --> 00:23:09,556
Is there any real hope?
Can these Titans be stopped?

441
00:23:09,636 --> 00:23:12,646
No. But still,
we'll struggle against

442
00:23:12,726 --> 00:23:14,436
the inevitable for
as long as we can.

443
00:23:14,516 --> 00:23:15,266
[HANGE]
Excuse me.

444
00:23:15,356 --> 00:23:17,476
[BOTH gasp]

445
00:23:17,566 --> 00:23:19,486
[HANGE]
Whoa, whoa, wait!

446
00:23:20,896 --> 00:23:22,946
No need to eat me, okay?

447
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:25,866
I'm not a threat, I didn't
even bring any weapons.

448
00:23:27,236 --> 00:23:30,156
Oh! Wondering who
I've got over there?

449
00:23:30,246 --> 00:23:33,206
Yeah. He's not a
threat either, honest.

450
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:36,956
He's just a poor bastard
who refuses to die.

451
00:23:41,166 --> 00:23:44,176
[NARRATOR] The walls of
Paradis continue to walk.

452
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,886
When the people
of the world look up

453
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:50,266
and see their colossal figures,
will they be frozen with fear?

454
00:23:50,346 --> 00:23:51,976
Or will they strike back?

455
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:54,936
Next episode: "Pride."
