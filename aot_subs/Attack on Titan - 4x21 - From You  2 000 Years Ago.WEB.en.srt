176
00:19:40,676 --> 00:19:44,226
It looked like it materialized
from where Eren was.

177
00:19:44,306 --> 00:19:46,226
Could it be...

178
00:19:46,316 --> 00:19:49,566
Eren really did it. It's over!

179
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:50,606
I can't hear you!

180
00:19:50,686 --> 00:19:52,566
The war is over and we won!

181
00:19:52,646 --> 00:19:53,646
Huh?

182
00:19:53,736 --> 00:19:55,486
Eren's using the power
of the Founder!

183
00:19:55,566 --> 00:19:56,736
[MIKASA gasps]

184
00:19:56,816 --> 00:19:59,036
That has to be why
the rumbling has started.

185
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:01,036
This is what Eren
wanted all along.

186
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,826
He's gonna send
these Titans to Marley

187
00:20:02,906 --> 00:20:06,286
and crush the global
military alliance!

188
00:20:06,376 --> 00:20:10,706
Eren's still our ally!
He always has been!

189
00:20:19,846 --> 00:20:21,516
Zeke, did you...?

190
00:20:25,136 --> 00:20:27,896
Eren. Are you still yourself?

191
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,776
Have you really
come back to our side?

192
00:20:30,856 --> 00:20:34,236
Wait a second. What's going on?

193
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,776
There's no way. He would never.

194
00:20:36,856 --> 00:20:37,696
Mikasa!

195
00:20:37,776 --> 00:20:39,116
[Gasps]

196
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:42,116
[ARMIN] All the walls are
falling, even Wall Maria!

197
00:20:42,196 --> 00:20:45,156
But he doesn't need that many
Titans to attack Marley.

198
00:20:45,246 --> 00:20:47,666
This is complete overkill!

199
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:50,706
Just the wall around Shiganshina
would be more than enough.

200
00:20:50,796 --> 00:20:53,756
He has no reason to give up
the walls completely.

201
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:55,376
Not if the plan is
just to knock out

202
00:20:55,466 --> 00:20:57,336
the global alliance in Marley.

203
00:20:57,426 --> 00:21:00,176
So why do this?
What could he be--?

204
00:21:00,556 --> 00:21:03,636
[EREN]
Hear me. Subjects of Ymir.

205
00:21:04,806 --> 00:21:09,356
[MIKASA gasps] It's him.
That was Eren's voice!

206
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:12,776
[EREN]
My name is Eren Jaeger.

207
00:21:12,856 --> 00:21:15,816
I'm addressing my fellow
Subjects of Ymir.

208
00:21:15,896 --> 00:21:19,736
Speaking to you directly through
the power of the Founder.

209
00:21:19,816 --> 00:21:21,946
All the walls
on the island of Paradis

210
00:21:22,036 --> 00:21:24,036
have crumbled to the ground,

211
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:28,246
and the legions of Titans buried
within have begun their march.

212
00:21:29,286 --> 00:21:31,086
[EREN]
My only goal

213
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,796
is to protect the lives of
the people of Paradis,

214
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:36,166
the island where I was born.

215
00:21:37,086 --> 00:21:40,176
[EREN] Right now, the nations
of the world are united

216
00:21:40,556 --> 00:21:43,386
in their desire to
exterminate my people,

217
00:21:43,466 --> 00:21:46,016
and it won't end
with our island.

218
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,726
They won't be satisfied until

219
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,726
every last Subject
of Ymir is dead.

220
00:21:50,806 --> 00:21:54,226
I won't let them have their way.

221
00:21:54,316 --> 00:21:57,696
The Titans of the walls
will continue their march

222
00:21:57,776 --> 00:22:02,196
until every trace of life beyond
our shores is trampled flat,

223
00:22:02,276 --> 00:22:06,956
and the people of Paradis are
all that remains of humanity.

224

♪ Ending Song ♪

225
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:43,676
[NARRATOR]
The ground rumbles underfoot.

226
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:46,216
A pillar of dust
touches the sky,

227
00:23:46,306 --> 00:23:49,466
heralding the horde of
Titans on the horizon.

228
00:23:49,556 --> 00:23:52,806
The walls of Paradis are gone.
