1
00:00:01,711 --> 00:00:03,627
We were abandoned.

2
00:00:03,711 --> 00:00:05,360
Abandoned by the devils

3
00:00:05,444 --> 00:00:07,842
whose blood runs through our veins.

4
00:00:08,911 --> 00:00:12,961
That's why we're forced
to live in this walled ghetto.

5
00:00:13,045 --> 00:00:15,709
And it's why your father isn't here.

6
00:00:18,045 --> 00:00:20,976
Your father is Marleyan.

7
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:25,742
So it's against the
rules for him to be with us.

8
00:00:26,578 --> 00:00:28,909
If only we were Marleyan...

9
00:00:37,045 --> 00:00:39,842
Oh, yeah. Back then...

10
00:00:40,778 --> 00:00:43,027
I strove to be a Warrior so Mom and I

11
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:44,775
could become Marleyans.

12
00:00:49,911 --> 00:00:51,761
Who said you could walk?

13
00:00:51,845 --> 00:00:55,427
Faster! Run,
you filthy seed of swine!

14
00:00:55,511 --> 00:00:58,242
Don't you wanna become
Honorary Marleyans?

15
00:01:01,778 --> 00:01:03,027
Did you guys hear?

16
00:01:03,111 --> 00:01:07,042
In just a few years, we'll be
sent to attack Paradis Island.

17
00:01:08,178 --> 00:01:11,961
It's almost time
for us to inherit our Titans.

18
00:01:12,045 --> 00:01:15,627
Out of us seven,
six'll be made Warriors at once.

19
00:01:15,711 --> 00:01:18,961
No way! I'll finally
become Marleyan!

20
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:21,427
Huh? What're you excited for?

21
00:01:21,511 --> 00:01:23,627
If anyone's getting
left behind, it's you.

22
00:01:23,711 --> 00:01:25,027
What?

23
00:01:25,111 --> 00:01:27,027
What do you got
that the rest of us don't?

24
00:01:27,111 --> 00:01:28,294
Huh?

25
00:01:28,378 --> 00:01:30,561
Are you real strong? Real smart?

26
00:01:30,645 --> 00:01:33,427
A crack shot?
Good in a fight maybe?

27
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:36,627
No. You only made it
this far by constantly

28
00:01:36,711 --> 00:01:39,494
going on about your love for Marley.

29
00:01:39,578 --> 00:01:41,627
"Yes, sir, I'll slaughter
those island devils

30
00:01:41,711 --> 00:01:44,427
just as soon as I've licked
your boots cle... "Hey!

31
00:01:44,511 --> 00:01:46,627
Are you seriously insulting our mission?

32
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:47,627
How dare you!

33
00:01:47,711 --> 00:01:50,027
You almost sound like
a stray Restorationist.

34
00:01:50,111 --> 00:01:50,961
Huh?!

35
00:01:51,045 --> 00:01:52,627
You traitor. I knew it!

36
00:01:52,711 --> 00:01:55,360
I'll report you to
the commander for this!

37
00:01:55,444 --> 00:01:57,441
Report this... you little shit!

38
00:01:58,645 --> 00:01:59,561
Well? Want more?

39
00:01:59,645 --> 00:02:00,961
He's had enough, Porco!

40
00:02:01,045 --> 00:02:04,027
Anyone can whine about
how much they hate the island.

41
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,709
That's why you'll be doing it
here for the next 13 years.

42
00:02:09,779 --> 00:02:10,761
Porco!

43
00:02:10,845 --> 00:02:12,827
Come on, Pieck, let's go.

44
00:02:12,911 --> 00:02:14,961
Hurry after us as soon as
you're done crying.

45
00:02:15,045 --> 00:02:17,275
I'll catch another
beating if you're late.

46
00:02:18,578 --> 00:02:21,208
Reiner. I'm sorry.

47
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:27,675
Get up, Reiner. Here.

48
00:02:28,645 --> 00:02:30,827
I have to become a Marleyan,

49
00:02:30,911 --> 00:02:33,027
so I can live with my mom and dad.

50
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:35,275
I can't wait 13 years.

51
00:02:36,378 --> 00:02:38,361
But, it's like he said,

52
00:02:38,445 --> 00:02:40,427
I... I'm weak.

53
00:02:40,511 --> 00:02:42,761
It isn't gonna be
Porco's decision to make.

54
00:02:42,845 --> 00:02:45,961
And well, loyalty's more
important than he might think.

55
00:02:46,045 --> 00:02:47,675
Right? Annie?

56
00:02:48,378 --> 00:02:51,275
Huh? Dunno. I was distracted.

57
00:02:59,778 --> 00:03:00,827
So this goal.

58
00:03:00,911 --> 00:03:02,627
Are you sure it's what you want?

59
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:03,561
Huh?

60
00:03:03,645 --> 00:03:05,976
You get 13 years, and that's it.

61
00:03:06,845 --> 00:03:09,642
But I'll be a hero for every one of them.

62
00:03:11,645 --> 00:03:13,761
If I can defeat the devils on Paradis,

63
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:15,561
I'll have saved the whole world.

64
00:03:15,645 --> 00:03:19,542
And after that, my parents'll
be proud to call me son.

65
00:03:23,645 --> 00:03:27,761
I wish something would happen.

66
00:03:27,845 --> 00:03:29,976
Eren! I finally found you!

67
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,913
Incredible.

68
00:05:07,997 --> 00:05:10,494
They're even stronger than expected.

69
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,513
The Female Titan.

70
00:05:16,597 --> 00:05:19,779
Its greatest strength is its versatility.

71
00:05:19,863 --> 00:05:21,579
Not only does it boast a combination of

72
00:05:21,663 --> 00:05:23,446
high mobility and endurance,

73
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:26,260
its hardened strikes are
incredibly destructive.

74
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,847
It's also able to summon Pure Titans.

75
00:05:29,931 --> 00:05:34,127
Though its range is limited.
Leonhart is perfect.

76
00:05:35,863 --> 00:05:37,179
The Armored Titan naturally

77
00:05:37,263 --> 00:05:39,179
specializes in defense.

78
00:05:39,263 --> 00:05:40,847
But if it charges at full speed,

79
00:05:40,931 --> 00:05:44,047
it can break through
gates and walls alike.

80
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,179
As Marley's shield,
it needs to stand tall

81
00:05:46,263 --> 00:05:48,047
where the fighting is thickest.

82
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:50,627
It suits Braun's tenacious spirit.

83
00:05:52,263 --> 00:05:54,646
The Jaw Titan is an assault weapon.

84
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,979
It's as speedy as it is small,

85
00:05:56,063 --> 00:05:59,761
with powerful claws and teeth
that can crush almost anything.

86
00:06:02,263 --> 00:06:04,727
Marcel's sharp enough to keep up with it.

87
00:06:05,597 --> 00:06:08,179
The Beast Titan is more potent than ever.

88
00:06:08,263 --> 00:06:11,112
It's large and strong,
but more importantly,

89
00:06:11,196 --> 00:06:12,713
it can outperform an artillery unit

90
00:06:12,797 --> 00:06:15,127
with nothing but a fistful of rock.

91
00:06:15,997 --> 00:06:16,847
What's more,

92
00:06:16,931 --> 00:06:19,928
its greatest power lies in its blood.

93
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,579
The Cart Titan's outstanding endurance

94
00:06:24,663 --> 00:06:28,513
makes it well-suited for
lengthy missions on the field.

95
00:06:28,597 --> 00:06:30,646
Because it can hold
its form for days on end,

96
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:33,913
we've enhanced it with
specialized equipment.

97
00:06:33,997 --> 00:06:36,727
Pieck's superior judgment
will serve well here.

98
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:41,627
Finally, there's the Colossal Titan.

99
00:06:50,931 --> 00:06:53,594
It is a god of destruction.

100
00:06:54,396 --> 00:06:57,179
We trust that Hoover can handle it.

101
00:06:57,263 --> 00:06:59,446
I feel bad for those island devils.

102
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:00,713
That monster will appear from thin air

103
00:07:00,797 --> 00:07:02,928
and start killing them someday.

104
00:07:03,797 --> 00:07:06,179
We've been training the
members of this Warrior Unit

105
00:07:06,263 --> 00:07:08,513
since they were practically infants,

106
00:07:08,597 --> 00:07:11,179
and it's clear that
they're stronger for it.

107
00:07:11,263 --> 00:07:14,513
But why send these children
to take the Founding Titan?

108
00:07:14,597 --> 00:07:16,646
Frankly, I think it's a bit insane.

109
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,913
You think so? I'm not so sure.

110
00:07:18,996 --> 00:07:22,978
We did just watch these children
bring a nation to its knees.

111
00:07:23,062 --> 00:07:24,779
It makes no sense!

112
00:07:24,863 --> 00:07:26,978
You're obviously at
the bottom of the group.

113
00:07:27,062 --> 00:07:28,847
So why would they pick you?

114
00:07:28,931 --> 00:07:33,828
Heh. Haven't you figured it out?
You're at the bottom. "Pock."

115
00:07:35,063 --> 00:07:36,579
You little...!

116
00:07:36,663 --> 00:07:38,179
Porco, stop! Calm down.

117
00:07:38,263 --> 00:07:40,461
You don't want to defy the brass.

118
00:07:45,797 --> 00:07:49,361
Reiner. I'm sorry.

119
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:04,847
Dad!

120
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:05,979
It's you, right?

121
00:08:06,063 --> 00:08:08,179
My mom used to work at this barracks

122
00:08:08,263 --> 00:08:09,978
a good while before I was born.

123
00:08:10,062 --> 00:08:11,513
You would've met her here.

124
00:08:11,597 --> 00:08:13,446
Her name's Karina Braun!

125
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,913
Look at my armband!

126
00:08:14,996 --> 00:08:15,979
Mom has one, too.

127
00:08:16,063 --> 00:08:18,179
We're Honorary Marleyans.
Now we can all live toge...

128
00:08:18,263 --> 00:08:19,978
The hell's wrong with you?

129
00:08:20,062 --> 00:08:21,978
What, did that woman send you here?

130
00:08:22,062 --> 00:08:24,513
Guess she wants
revenge on me. Shit!

131
00:08:24,597 --> 00:08:26,978
She forced you to become
a Warrior just for that?

132
00:08:27,062 --> 00:08:29,912
If they find out where you're
from, my family's screwed.

133
00:08:29,996 --> 00:08:32,046
So you're trying to get
me hanged, is that it?

134
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,978
Well I'm running away as fast as I can.

135
00:08:35,062 --> 00:08:37,861
Away from you and
your damned Eldian mother!

136
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:41,527
Reiner! Reiner!

137
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:45,046
I'll be waiting for you, sweetie!

138
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:48,513
That's right.
Even if I don't have a dad,

139
00:08:48,597 --> 00:08:51,527
I was chosen to wield the Armored Titan.

140
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:54,112
I'll save everyone from the island devils

141
00:08:54,196 --> 00:08:56,828
and become a hero to the world.

142
00:09:05,996 --> 00:09:09,179
It's tough to cover
much ground, moving at night.

143
00:09:09,263 --> 00:09:11,713
Yeah, especially when it's this cloudy.

144
00:09:11,797 --> 00:09:14,513
We're sure the king won't
use the Founding Titan?

145
00:09:14,597 --> 00:09:15,579
I don't get it.

146
00:09:15,663 --> 00:09:18,112
If we blatantly attack his walls, then...

147
00:09:18,196 --> 00:09:19,979
What's the point in asking now?

148
00:09:20,063 --> 00:09:21,979
Just put your faith in Marley's research.

149
00:09:22,063 --> 00:09:25,179
That's right.
There's no turning back.

150
00:09:25,263 --> 00:09:28,828
When we reach the wall
tomorrow, we'll have to...

151
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:33,579
Huh? What's wrong?

152
00:09:33,663 --> 00:09:36,647
Don't tell me you're feeling
hesitant to kill these devils.

153
00:09:36,731 --> 00:09:39,179
They're a threat to our entire world!

154
00:09:39,263 --> 00:09:42,713
But the greatest nation in
the world chose us to save it.

155
00:09:42,797 --> 00:09:44,994
To punish these devils for their crimes!

156
00:09:47,862 --> 00:09:48,912
I'm sorry.

157
00:09:48,996 --> 00:09:49,912
Huh?

158
00:09:49,996 --> 00:09:53,513
Listen, Reiner.
The truth of it is,

159
00:09:53,597 --> 00:09:56,446
you were never supposed to be chosen.

160
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:57,979
I influenced the army's decision

161
00:09:58,063 --> 00:09:59,979
by making my little brother look bad,

162
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,127
and putting you up on a pedestal.

163
00:10:04,996 --> 00:10:10,912
Sorry. I only did it so
that he would... be safe...

164
00:10:10,996 --> 00:10:13,594
I'm sorry... Reiner...

165
00:10:18,196 --> 00:10:19,594
Why?

166
00:10:21,930 --> 00:10:24,361
Why are you apologizing?

167
00:10:46,796 --> 00:10:49,046
Bertholdt! Annie!

168
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:50,927
Marcel...

169
00:10:52,263 --> 00:10:56,912
They're gone. They were
all eaten because of me.

170
00:10:56,996 --> 00:10:58,846
And I'll be next.

171
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:01,260
I... I'm gonna die here.

172
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:08,513
Not bad. You just beat me

173
00:11:08,597 --> 00:11:10,113
in a long-distance race.

174
00:11:10,197 --> 00:11:12,260
You've never done that before.

175
00:11:13,263 --> 00:11:16,912
If we had transformed
and defended ourselves,

176
00:11:16,996 --> 00:11:19,179
we wouldn't have lost the Jaw Titan.

177
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:22,179
Ugh. Well. Shit.

178
00:11:22,263 --> 00:11:24,579
He's gone for good now.

179
00:11:24,663 --> 00:11:26,179
There weren't supposed to be any Titans

180
00:11:26,263 --> 00:11:27,979
this far from the walls, though.

181
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:29,528
We need to go back.

182
00:11:30,397 --> 00:11:32,447
Let's track down Jaws and leave.

183
00:11:32,531 --> 00:11:35,513
The Titan that ate Marcel
should be human again.

184
00:11:35,597 --> 00:11:39,694
C'mon. Without Marcel to
lead us, this mission's doomed.

185
00:11:42,531 --> 00:11:46,494
Wait. We can't. We can't!

186
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:48,912
We can't go!

187
00:11:48,996 --> 00:11:51,394
We gotta continue the mission as planned.

188
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:56,513
Oh, yeah. If you go back now,
you'll be stripped of the Armor.

189
00:11:56,597 --> 00:11:58,779
The next Warrior will eat you.

190
00:11:58,863 --> 00:12:01,647
Though that isn't really
a problem for me.

191
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:03,179
You think it'd just be me?

192
00:12:03,263 --> 00:12:04,113
Huh?

193
00:12:04,197 --> 00:12:05,779
You and Bertholdt ran away, too,

194
00:12:05,863 --> 00:12:07,779
so why would I take all of the blame?

195
00:12:07,863 --> 00:12:09,712
What makes you so confident that you two

196
00:12:09,796 --> 00:12:12,513
won't get eaten right along with me?

197
00:12:12,597 --> 00:12:15,113
Going after Jaws isn't
a good idea, anyway.

198
00:12:15,197 --> 00:12:17,179
If they use its power to run, that's it.

199
00:12:17,263 --> 00:12:19,912
Our Titans are way too
slow to catch up to it.

200
00:12:19,996 --> 00:12:22,046
But how could someone learn
to use it that quickly?

201
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,912
You mastered the Colossal on
your first try, so you tell me!

202
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:29,647
Anyway, if we go to the dock
as failures, we're doomed!

203
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,447
We need the Founding Titan.

204
00:12:31,531 --> 00:12:33,194
There's no going home without it!

205
00:12:33,996 --> 00:12:36,979
You know. If you had been
even a fraction this composed

206
00:12:37,063 --> 00:12:38,579
when that Titan came at us,

207
00:12:38,662 --> 00:12:42,179
we wouldn't have had to
lose the Jaw Titan or Marcel.

208
00:12:42,263 --> 00:12:44,113
So, you think the two of us'll be blamed

209
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:45,927
for running after you, huh?

210
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:50,513
Well, then why don't you
come clean to Magath?

211
00:12:50,597 --> 00:12:52,779
It's your fault this happened,
so own up to it!

212
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,979
We're not heroes, dumbass.

213
00:12:55,063 --> 00:12:57,712
The Marleyans just see us as weapons.

214
00:12:57,796 --> 00:12:58,912
Understand? They lied!

215
00:12:58,996 --> 00:13:02,447
Marleyan or Eldian, they're all
just in it for themselves!

216
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:03,579
And guess what?

217
00:13:03,662 --> 00:13:05,712
I'm the same:
I've gotta get home alive!

218
00:13:05,796 --> 00:13:08,046
If you feel guilty
about Marcel, then die!

219
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:11,127
Take all of the blame and die!

220
00:13:24,796 --> 00:13:26,513
Reiner is dead.

221
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:29,961
If we need Marcel, then he's who I'll be.

222
00:13:32,796 --> 00:13:34,994
Stop. Let her go.

223
00:13:35,997 --> 00:13:40,113
If we wanna make it
back, this is our only hope.

224
00:13:40,197 --> 00:13:45,827
Once our mission is done, we can go home.

225
00:14:12,263 --> 00:14:14,979
I wanted to become a Warrior,

226
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,646
because I thought it
would make my mom's wish

227
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,361
to live with me and my father come true.

228
00:14:20,531 --> 00:14:24,659
But, my father never
wanted any part of us.

229
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:29,578
Mom lived for a dream
that she knew was hopeless.

230
00:14:29,662 --> 00:14:31,579
I should've never been chosen.

231
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,428
I should have died today.

232
00:14:35,531 --> 00:14:39,912
Why apologize?
And why save someone like me?

233
00:14:39,996 --> 00:14:42,113
This can't end with me doing nothing.

234
00:14:42,197 --> 00:14:43,913
Knowing nothing.

235
00:14:43,997 --> 00:14:47,594
Before I die, I need to change something!

236
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,779
Where are we?

237
00:14:55,863 --> 00:14:57,727
In Wall Rose. We're safe.

238
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:04,913
Annie. Bertholdt. I'm sorry.

239
00:15:04,997 --> 00:15:09,913
I'll be the Warrior
I should've been... for Marcel.

240
00:15:09,997 --> 00:15:14,113
Oxface! Just what in the
hell did you come here to do?

241
00:15:14,197 --> 00:15:16,428
I'm here to save humanity.

242
00:15:24,663 --> 00:15:28,046
My village was in the southeast
mountains of Wall Maria.

243
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,512
For us, it happened at dawn.

244
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,579
The animals were all makin' a racket.

245
00:15:32,663 --> 00:15:35,512
On top of that, I heard
a strange rumbling.

246
00:15:35,596 --> 00:15:39,094
I realized it was footsteps
and opened the window to look.

247
00:15:40,863 --> 00:15:42,646
What happened next is a blur,

248
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:46,179
but I got away
on my horse. Alone.

249
00:15:46,263 --> 00:15:49,461
Leaving behind three kids
right about your age.

250
00:16:00,462 --> 00:16:01,779
Hello there, missy.

251
00:16:01,863 --> 00:16:03,779
You must be a girl of refined taste

252
00:16:03,863 --> 00:16:06,979
to take such an interest
in this old geezer.

253
00:16:07,063 --> 00:16:09,779
I was born at the inn my mom worked at.

254
00:16:09,863 --> 00:16:11,113
She only met my father once,

255
00:16:11,197 --> 00:16:13,379
but she described him to me in detail,

256
00:16:13,462 --> 00:16:15,379
so that I'd know you when I saw you.

257
00:16:15,462 --> 00:16:17,046
Well, ain't that a touchin' story.

258
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:20,512
If ya wanna give your daddy
a hug, then put your hands up.

259
00:16:20,596 --> 00:16:23,379
How can you be so sure
that it isn't true?

260
00:16:23,462 --> 00:16:25,113
I made my sister a promise,

261
00:16:25,197 --> 00:16:28,694
so this tale of yours is a joke,
and a shit one at that.

262
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:32,627
You're so mean. Daddy!

263
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:40,913
Well, damn. Seems you've
hit your rebellious phase.

264
00:16:40,997 --> 00:16:42,094
Come back!

265
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,579
Huh. That's a new one.

266
00:16:45,663 --> 00:16:47,979
His legs are saying
it'll snow today, right?

267
00:16:48,063 --> 00:16:50,979
Yeah, but his torso's saying clear skies.

268
00:16:51,063 --> 00:16:52,979
Call it hail and get moving

269
00:16:53,063 --> 00:16:54,713
or you'll be late for muster.

270
00:16:54,797 --> 00:16:56,594
Bertholdt! Wake up!

271
00:16:57,596 --> 00:16:59,579
While you two slept like babies

272
00:16:59,663 --> 00:17:01,779
after playing with your "friends,"

273
00:17:01,863 --> 00:17:04,579
I was crawling around
the capital's sewers.

274
00:17:04,663 --> 00:17:08,179
But I hit my limit.
Almost got caught.

275
00:17:08,263 --> 00:17:09,979
Your limit, huh?

276
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:13,046
Let's cut our losses and take
what we know back to Marley.

277
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:16,113
At this point, I bet they'll
be happy to hear anything.

278
00:17:16,197 --> 00:17:19,979
No. After five years,
they'll be expecting a lot more

279
00:17:20,063 --> 00:17:22,779
than a few scraps of information.

280
00:17:22,863 --> 00:17:25,579
All right, asshole.
Do you have a plan?

281
00:17:25,663 --> 00:17:27,712
Yeah. We breach Wall Rose.

282
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,893
It's the best chance we have of
smoking out the Founding Titan.

283
00:17:31,663 --> 00:17:34,494
It also means killing
a lot of your friends.

284
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,579
I keep telling you, Annie.

285
00:17:37,663 --> 00:17:40,113
The cadets aren't our
friends. They're devils.

286
00:17:40,197 --> 00:17:43,047
But it can't hurt to gain their
trust, so I wish you'd act

287
00:17:43,131 --> 00:17:45,179
a little less standoff-ish.
Let them think you're one...

288
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:46,779
I'm gonna puke.

289
00:17:46,863 --> 00:17:49,446
Could you please move
your face away from mine?

290
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:53,179
You're exhausted.

291
00:17:53,263 --> 00:17:56,712
I'm sorry for laying so many
burdens on you, Annie.

292
00:17:56,796 --> 00:17:58,394
Let's call it a night.

293
00:18:04,063 --> 00:18:07,512
I, uh... I keep
having this dream.

294
00:18:07,596 --> 00:18:11,446
Where I see that guy from the
mountains who hung himself.

295
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,646
He must've been planning to do it.

296
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,394
So why did he tell us his story first?

297
00:18:24,863 --> 00:18:26,779
Eren. Don't kill yourself.

298
00:18:26,863 --> 00:18:28,379
Take a break.

299
00:18:28,463 --> 00:18:31,779
Shit! Hey, Reiner.

300
00:18:31,863 --> 00:18:33,979
How'd you get so strong?

301
00:18:34,063 --> 00:18:37,579
What do I need to do to
be like you or Mikasa?

302
00:18:37,663 --> 00:18:38,979
I've gotta change,

303
00:18:39,063 --> 00:18:42,094
or I'll die without
accomplishing a damn thing.

304
00:18:48,131 --> 00:18:49,794
Just do what you have to.

305
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,861
Keep moving forward.

306
00:18:54,596 --> 00:18:56,379
That's all we can do.

307
00:18:56,463 --> 00:18:59,327
Right. Thanks for the advice.

308
00:19:01,131 --> 00:19:03,460
You're gonna butcher
all the Titans, right?

309
00:19:04,463 --> 00:19:06,028
I'm sure you can do it.

310
00:19:21,997 --> 00:19:25,727
Damn it. If nothing
changes, then...

311
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:37,994
That's right.
I still have... them.

312
00:19:46,663 --> 00:19:48,579
The hospital.

313
00:19:48,663 --> 00:19:49,827
Hey!

314
00:19:55,262 --> 00:19:57,979
So, you're able to talk now, huh?

315
00:19:58,063 --> 00:20:00,646
Guess that means you're recovering.

316
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:04,113
Eh. This place is for
treating psychological wounds,

317
00:20:04,197 --> 00:20:06,379
but mine are fake.

318
00:20:06,463 --> 00:20:07,513
Huh?

319
00:20:07,597 --> 00:20:10,779
I said that I forgot where
I came from due to amnesia,

320
00:20:10,863 --> 00:20:13,179
but I just don't wanna go back.

321
00:20:13,262 --> 00:20:16,427
I'm not quite ready
to face my family yet.

322
00:20:17,663 --> 00:20:19,512
Will you report me?

323
00:20:19,596 --> 00:20:21,661
No, I wouldn't do that.

324
00:20:22,663 --> 00:20:24,113
You're all beat up.

325
00:20:24,196 --> 00:20:26,579
Guess that's from your Warrior training?

326
00:20:26,663 --> 00:20:30,113
Yeah, but honestly, it's pointless.

327
00:20:30,196 --> 00:20:32,979
There's another candidate
who's way better than me.

328
00:20:33,063 --> 00:20:35,579
So there's no way that I'll be chosen.

329
00:20:35,663 --> 00:20:37,379
I'm glad to hear it.

330
00:20:37,463 --> 00:20:38,113
Huh?

331
00:20:38,196 --> 00:20:39,913
You're a good person.

332
00:20:39,997 --> 00:20:42,594
I hope you'll get to live a long life.

333
00:20:44,663 --> 00:20:47,913
Thing is, I don't want this
other candidate to be picked.

334
00:20:47,997 --> 00:20:49,427
Why not?

335
00:20:51,863 --> 00:20:54,913
Is this rival of yours a girl by chance?

336
00:20:54,997 --> 00:20:57,047
She's famous around here.

337
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:59,561
She did incredible things in the war.

338
00:21:00,931 --> 00:21:02,579
Ask anyone, and they'll tell you

339
00:21:02,663 --> 00:21:05,178
that she should be the next Armor.

340
00:21:05,262 --> 00:21:07,713
It doesn't matter what I want.

341
00:21:07,797 --> 00:21:10,494
'Cause I can't do a damn thing about it.

342
00:21:14,196 --> 00:21:17,178
Every day I've spent here, I've wondered.

343
00:21:17,262 --> 00:21:20,779
How did all these people
let it come to this?

344
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:23,178
Minds and bodies ruined.

345
00:21:23,262 --> 00:21:25,646
Dreams of freedom erased.

346
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:28,178
Personalities burned away.

347
00:21:28,262 --> 00:21:30,713
No one would want to go to war

348
00:21:30,797 --> 00:21:33,847
if they knew what it would do to them.

349
00:21:33,931 --> 00:21:37,779
But it's not like we all
leapt into that hell knowingly.

350
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,779
Most of us were pushed.

351
00:21:39,863 --> 00:21:42,779
Some of us were pushed by other people.

352
00:21:42,863 --> 00:21:47,379
And some of us were pushed by
the environments we grew up in.

353
00:21:47,463 --> 00:21:50,779
So, the few who do
choose to leap into hell

354
00:21:50,863 --> 00:21:53,112
see it differently than the rest.

355
00:21:53,196 --> 00:21:56,979
And they're also able to see
something beyond the hell.

356
00:21:57,063 --> 00:21:59,179
Maybe that something is hope.

357
00:21:59,263 --> 00:22:02,112
Or maybe it's just another hell.

358
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:06,861
Fact is, you can only
find out by moving forward.

359
00:23:40,671 --> 00:23:43,453
Magath joins hands with the Tybur family

360
00:23:43,537 --> 00:23:46,453
and readies the army
for a fateful speech.

361
00:23:46,537 --> 00:23:48,653
As the festival enlivens the city,

362
00:23:48,737 --> 00:23:51,653
Reiner is surprised
by a face from his past.

363
00:23:51,737 --> 00:23:54,768
Next episode:
"From One Hand to Another."
